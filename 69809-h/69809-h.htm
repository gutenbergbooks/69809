  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='large'>A STARTLING RENCONTRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Two travelers on board the ocean steamer <em>Scorpio</em>,
bound from New York to Liverpool, were Gentleman Geff
and his queenly bride.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was in blissful ignorance that his forsaken wife and
her infant were on the same ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife whom he believed to be in her pauper grave in
potter’s field, and the child of whose birth he had never
heard!</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff was riding on the topmost wave of success
and popularity. He had paid a high price for his fortune,
but he told himself continually that the fortune was
worth all he had given for it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Certainly there were two awful pictures that would present
themselves to his mental vision with terrible distinctness
and persistent regularity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first was of a deep wood, in the dead of night, and a
young man’s ghastly face turned up to the starlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other was of a silent city street, in the dark hours before
day, and a girl’s form prone upon the pavement, with a
dark stream creeping from a wound in her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were moments when the murderer would have
given all that he had gained by his crimes to wake up and
find that they had all been “the phantasmagoria of a midnight
dream”; that he was not the counterfeit Randolph
Hay, Esquire, of Haymore, with a rent roll of twenty
thousand pounds sterling a year, and an income from invested
funds of twice as much, and with two atrocious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>murders on his soul, but simply the poor devil of an adventurer
who lived by his wits, and was known to the miners
as Gentleman Geff.</p>

<p class='c009'>At such times he would drink deeply of brandy, and
under its influence find all his views change. He would
philosophize about life, fortune, destiny, necessity, and try
to persuade himself that he had been more sinned against
than sinning. He then felt sure that, if he had been born
to wealth, he would have been a philanthropist of the highest
order, a benefactor to the whole human race; would have
founded churches, and sent out missionaries; would have
established hospitals and asylums, and erected model tenement
houses for the poor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah! how good and great a man he would have proved
himself if he had only been born to vast wealth! But he
had been born to genteel poverty. Fate had been unkind.
It was all the fault of fate, he argued.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this exaltation he would go into the gentlemen’s
saloon, sit down at one of the gaming tables, and stake,
and win or lose, large sums of money; and so, in the feverish
mental and physical excitement of drinking and gambling,
he would seek to drive away remorse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Often he would drink himself into a state of maudlin
sentimentality, and in that state reel into the stateroom
occupied by himself and his bride. He was really more “in
love” with Lamia Leegh than he had ever been with any
woman in his long career of “lady-killing.” He had married
her for love, although it was the Turk’s love.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Lamia did not love him in the least. She had married
him for rank, money and position. She had begun by
liking him, then enduring him, and now she ended by detesting
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some poor girls marry old men for money; some marry
ugly men or withered men for the same cause; but to marry
a drunkard for that, or for any cause; to be obliged to live
with the beast; to be unable to escape from him; to see him
day and night; to smell his nauseous breath—it is horrible,
abhorrent, abominable!” she said to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet she never dared to let her disgust and abhorrence appear
to its object. She was too politic to offend him, for—he
held the purse strings. There had been no settlements—nothing
of the sort—notwithstanding all the talk about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>them with Will Walling. For every dollar she would receive
she must depend on her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Cashmere shawls and sable furs and solitaire diamonds
that she longed for, if she should get them at all,
must be got from him, and she knew she would get them,
and everything else she might want, so long as he should
possess his fortune and she retain his favor. So she veiled
her dislike under a show of affection, and she even made
for herself a rule and set for herself a task, so that he might
never find out her real feelings toward him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The more disgusted she might really be, the more enamored
she would pretend to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was surely a very hard way of earning diamonds
and the rest, but, like Gentleman Geff, she told herself that
they were worth it; and she thought so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their fellow passengers all knew them to be a newly married
pair; for there happened to be a few New York
“society” people on the ship, who had heard all about the
grand wedding at Peter Vansitart’s, and they had spread
the news in the first cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their fellow voyagers also believed them to be a very
happy couple; though ladies sometimes whispered together
that he certainly did look rather dissipated; and gentlemen
remarked to each other that it was a pity he drank so hard
and played so high. It was a bad beginning at his age, and
if it should continue Haymore fortunes could scarcely
“stand the racket.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But notwithstanding these drawbacks, Mr. and Mrs. Randolph
Hay were very popular among their fellow voyagers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The weather continued good for the first week.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bride and groom were daily to be seen on deck—well
wrapped up, for the fine October days were cold on midocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet though they were every day on deck, they had never
yet encountered Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>How was that? And where was Jennie?</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie Montgomery was in her stateroom, so prostrated
by seasickness that she was scarcely able to take care of her
child. She had never once left her room even to go into the
ladies’ saloon, but passed her time between her lower berth
and her broad sofa.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stewardess Hopkins became interested in poor little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Jennie and her baby—“one as much of a baby as t’other,”
she had said to one of the stateroom stewards—and so she
showed them kindness from a heartfelt sympathy, such as
no fee could have purchased.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the eighth day out, Mrs. Hopkins was in the room
with the young mother and child, when Jennie, looking
gratefully at the stewardess, said, with tears in her eyes:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mrs. Hopkins, I do thank you with all my heart,
but feel so deeply that that is not enough. I shall never,
never be able to repay you for all your goodness to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t talk in that way, my dear,” replied the stewardess,
in self-depreciation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it were not for you, I believe that I and baby should
both die on the sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, dear. ‘The Lord tempers the wind to the shorn
lamb,’ and if I hadn’t been here He would have provided
some one else for you. But now, dear, I do really think you
ought to try and exert yourself to go up on deck. Here
we are a week at sea, and you have had no enjoyment of the
voyage at all. Don’t you think, now that the baby has gone
to sleep, and is safe to be quiet for two or three hours, you
could let me wrap you up warm and help you up on deck?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to do so, but I am not able; indeed I am
not. I am as weak as a rat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rats are remarkably strong for their size, my dear, for
they’re all muscle. And as for you being weak, it is only a
nervous fancy, caused by your seasickness. But you’re over
that now. And if you will only let me help you up on deck,
why, every step you take and every breath you breathe will
give you new life and strength,” persisted the stewardess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I will go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie stood up, holding by the edge of the upper berth
for support, while the stewardess prepared her to go up on
deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>And when last of all Jennie was well wrapped up in her
fur-lined cloak, Mrs. Hopkins led and supported her to the
stairs, and took her carefully up to the deck, and found her
a sheltered seat on the lee side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit here,” she said, “and every breath of this fresh air
you breathe will give you new life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And having tucked a rug well around the feet of her
charge, the stewardess left Jennie to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Jennie looked around her. There were very few people
within the range of her vision, only the man at the wheel
and two or three deck hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the luncheon hour, and nearly all the passengers
who were not in their staterooms had gone to the dining
saloon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Jennie looked abroad over the boundless expanse of
dazzling blue sea, leaping and sparkling under the light of
a radiant blue sky. It was splendid, glorious, but blinding
to vision just out of the shadows of the stateroom and cabin,
and so Jennie closed her eyes to recover them, and sat with
them closed for some moments. At this hour it was very
quiet on deck. Only the sounds of the ship’s movements
were heard. Jennie, with her tired eyes shut, sat there in
calm content.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I am going mad! I am going mad! It has taken
shape at last—or is this—delirium tremens? I—must not—drink
so much!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a low, husky, shuddering voice that uttered these
strange words in Jennie’s hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>She opened her eyes at the sound, looked up and saw——</p>

<p class='c009'>Kightly Montgomery, her husband, within a few feet of
her, staring in horror upon her, while he supported himself
in a collapsed state against the bulwarks of the ship. The
face that confronted her was ashen, ghastly, awe-stricken,
yet defiant, as with the impotent revolt of a demon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie returned his glare with a gaze of amazement and
perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so they remained spellbound, staring at each other,
without moving or speaking, for perhaps a full minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie was the first to recover herself. A moment’s reflection
enabled her to understand the situation—that
Kightly Montgomery, under his new name and with his
new wife, was her fellow passenger on the <em>Scorpio</em>. This
was clear enough to her now.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was also the first to break the spell of silence, though
it cost her an effort to do so, and her voice quivered, and
she lowered her eyes as she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You seem to take me for an optical illusion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He still glared at her without answering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am no ‘illusion,’” she continued, more steadily, gaining
more self-control every moment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“If not—what—in the devil—are you?” he gasped at
length, terrified, yet aggressive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am your wife; but shall never claim, or wish to claim,
the position,” she replied, still keeping her eyes down to
avoid the pain of seeing his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are—I do not—I thought——How——” he began,
in utter confusion of mind, and with his eyes starting
from the intensity of his stare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go away, please, and collect yourself. Do not fear me.
I shall not trouble you. But pray, go now, and do not come
near me or speak to me again,” said Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I thought—you were dead!” he blurted out, with
brutal bluntness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie reflected for a moment. Why should he have
thought that she was dead, even though he had tried to kill
her, and had indeed left her for dead? Then she concluded
that he must have fled from the city immediately after having
committed the crime by which he had intended to rid
himself of her forever; but she made no reply to his remark.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why have you followed me here?” he demanded, trying
to cover his intense anxiety with an air of bravado.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not follow you. I did not know that you were to
be on this boat. How should I have known it? And why
should I have followed you?” she calmly inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is it—that you are here, then?” he questioned, his
voice still shaking, his eyes staring, his form supported
against the bulwarks of the ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going home to my father’s house. When I got
well in the Samaritan Hospital a few good women of means
clubbed together and raised the funds to give me an outfit
and pay my passage to England. They engaged for me one
of the best staterooms in the ladies’ cabin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is it—that I have never seen you—or suspected
your presence on the ship before? Have you been hiding
from me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I have already told you that I did not know you
were on board. You have not seen me because I have been
seasick in my stateroom. This is my first day on deck.
And now will you please to go away and leave me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Presently. By Jove, Jennie, you take things very
coolly!” he exclaimed, drawing a handkerchief from his
breast pocket and wiping his forehead, on which beads of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>perspiration stood out. “What do you intend to do?” he
suddenly demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing to trouble you while you are on this ship. I do
not wish to see, or speak to, or even to know you here again,
and I will not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—well—I thank you for so much grace. But what will
you do after you shall have reached England?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall tell my father the whole story—of which he has
no suspicion now—and I shall place myself in his hands for
direction, and do whatever he counsels me to do. He was
my guard and guide all my life until I threw off his safe
authority and followed you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pity!” muttered Gentleman Geff to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now,” said Jennie, “once more, and for the third
time, I beg you to leave me. Let this distressing and most
improper interview come to an end at once. I think it is
both sinful and shameful, in view of the past and the
present, for you to speak to me, or even to look at me. Perhaps
I am doing wrong in keeping quiet. Perhaps I ought
to denounce you to the captain and officers of this ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That would be quite useless, my girl,” exclaimed Gentleman
Geff, daring to speak contemptuously for the first time
during the interview, yet still quaking between the conflicting
passions of terror and defiance; “you could not prove
anything against me here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably not; and my interference would not only be
useless, but worse than useless; it would make an ugly scandal,
and create a great disturbance. No, I will do nothing
until I take counsel with my father. But let me give you
this warning: My father is to meet me at Liverpool. Do
not let him see you then! And now, Capt. Montgomery,
if you do not leave me, I shall be obliged to go to my room,”
Jennie concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff turned away. It was time, for people
were leaving the dining saloon and coming up on deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several people—men, women and children—passed
Jennie on their way forward; nearly every one of these
glanced at Jennie with more or less interest; for hers was
a new face. Now, in the beginning of a sea voyage nearly
all the passengers are strangers to each other. But after
eight days, when every one on board is known to the other
by sight, a new face is an event. And this face was fair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>pensive and interesting, and it belonged to a young woman
who seemed to be quite alone on board.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among those who passed was a superbly beautiful woman,
whose Juno-like form was wrapped in a rich fur-lined cloak,
the hood of which was drawn over her lovely head, partly
concealing the glory of her red, gold-hued hair, and half
shading the radiance of her blond and blooming complexion.</p>

<p class='c009'>This goddess did something more than glance at the
pretty, pale, childlike form reclining there. She stopped
and gazed at her for a moment, and then, when Jennie
lowered her eyes, the goddess passed on.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the stream of passengers had all gone forward
Jennie drew a sigh of relief and composed herself to rest
and to think over the sudden, overwhelming interview
which had just passed between herself and her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie was troubled, not in her affections—for if Kightly
Montgomery had not succeeded in slaying her, he had certainly
managed to kill her love for him—but in her conscience.
Was she right in letting him go on in his course
of evil? Ought she not to stop it? But could she, even if
she tried? And she shrank from trying. For if she should
succeed in exposing him, what a terrible mortification it
would be to that unfortunate young lady whom he had
feloniously married; who was reported to be as religious
and charitable as she was beautiful and accomplished; who,
even in the busy week before her wedding day, had given
time to go out shopping for her—Jennie’s—outfit; and
whom it was now too late to save, since she had been living
with her supposed husband for a week.</p>

<p class='c009'>To expose him now, and here, would be to degrade her
before all the ship’s passengers, so that all who now admired,
honored or envied her, would soon pity and avoid
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie could not bring an “unoffending” fellow creature
to that pass; and if her forbearance was a sin, she hoped
the Lord would pardon her for His sake who pitied the
sinful woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Jennie was “wrestling” so in the spirit, the stewardess
came up and put her baby in her arms, smiling, and
saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I was passing by your stateroom I just looked in to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>see if all was right, and then I saw this little thing lying
wide awake and crowing to herself as good as pie. And I
thought I would wrap her up and bring her to you for a
breath of this good, fresh air, which, if it was doing you
good, wouldn’t do her harm. Was I right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, Mrs. Hopkins. And I thank you so much,”
said Jennie, as she stooped and kissed the babe that lay
upon her lap; but Mrs. Hopkins had already gone about
her business.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie smiled and cooed to the little one, enjoying its
presence, and rejoicing that Kightly Montgomery was gone
from her side and was not likely to return. She had purposely
avoided speaking of the child to him. She was glad
that he had not once inquired about it. She had almost a
superstitious dread of his seeing, touching or even knowing
of the babe, for fear that his evil nature might, in some
moral, physical or, perhaps, occult way, bring harm to the
little innocent.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was still bending over the babe, when a soft, sweet,
melodious voice addressed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon me, you are Mrs. Montgomery, are you not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie looked up. The goddess had come back. Jennie
did not know her, but she answered quietly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am Mrs. Randolph Hay; and that I had heard of you
and become interested in you must be my excuse for intruding
my acquaintance on you,” added the beauty, with a
bewitching smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie flushed, paled, trembled and cast down her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>This, then, was Lamia Leegh, the unfortunate young lady
whom Kightly Montgomery had married!</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie felt sorry for her, standing there in all the pride
and pomp of her beauty and wealth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind, madam,” was all that she could find
to say, in a low tone, with downcast eyes and flushed cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The goddess thought the little woman overpowered by
her own grandeur, smiled condescendingly, and said complacently:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a pretty baby you have! Girl or a boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Girl, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is right. I love girl babies. What is her name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is not christened yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“How old is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two months on the third of this month, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! She is well grown for that age. I need not ask
if she has good health. She looks so well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, madam. Thank Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the first time you have been on deck, I think?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suffered from seasickness, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam, until this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! very sad to have missed all this beautiful voyage.
An exceptionally fine voyage. I have crossed many times,
but have never experienced so fine a voyage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie did not reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, then, seasickness is a great benefit to some constitutions.
I hope that it will have been so in your case.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still Jennie did not answer, except by a bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you quite recovered?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite, ma’am, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet you feel weak?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will pass away. You are traveling quite alone, I
believe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, if I or Mr. Randolph Hay can be of any service
to you, I hope you will call on us. I, and I am sure Mr.
Hay also, would be very much pleased to serve you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you, madam, very much, but my dear father
will meet me at Liverpool, so that I shall not need assistance.
But equally I thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie would have said more had she been able. She
would have acknowledged the services or the supposed services
the lady had performed for her before they had ever
met; but her tongue “clove to the roof of her mouth,” so
to speak. It was all she could do to utter the perfunctory
words she had spoken, and these without raising her eyes to
the face of the goddess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Randolph Hay bowed graciously, and passed on
toward the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor thing!” breathed Jennie, with deep pity; “poor,
poor thing! She, so proud, so stately, so beautiful, to be
cast down to the dust! Oh, no! Heaven pardon me, but
I must spare him for her sake! I will do nothing until I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>see my father, and then I must tell him all, and be guided
by his counsels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So then Jennie stooped and kissed her baby and felt at
peace with all the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia Leegh was not one to hide her “light under a
bushel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before many hours had passed every one had heard the
pathetic story of the English curate’s young daughter, who
had been married, deserted and months afterward half
murdered by her husband; how she had been taken to the
Samaritan Hospital, where she became a mother; how certain
charitable ladies had become so interested in her case
that they had made up a fund to give her and her child an
outfit and send them home to her father, and how she was
on this very ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without claiming all the credit in so many words, Lamia
Leegh had left the impression on the minds of her hearers
that she herself had been the principal, if not the only, benefactress
of Jennie Montgomery, and she won applause for
her benevolence.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Kightly Montgomery left his wife seated on the
deck it was with a feeling of relief to get out of her presence.
He hurried to his stateroom, looked around, and
felt more relief to find that his deceived bride was absent.</p>

<p class='c009'>He kept a private stock of strong old brandy in a case.
He opened a bottle, poured out half a goblet full, and drank
it at a draught.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he felt better still.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will keep her word,” he said to himself. “If she
had intended to give me away, she would have done so before
this. Any man would have denounced another under
such circumstances. But these women are inexplicable. I
wonder if her child was born alive? I wonder if it is living,
and if she has it with her, or if she has placed it in some
asylum? Impossible to say. She volunteers no information
on the subject, and I certainly cannot question her
about it. She wishes me to avoid her. I am quite willing
to oblige her in that particular. I very much do not wish
to see her again. No, nor her father! I must not meet the
dominie, under present complications. It would be awkward.
I shall shirk that <i><span lang="fr">rencontre</span></i> by getting off the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>steamer at Queenstown and taking the mail route to London
via Kingstown and Holyhead. That will do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He filled and drank another half goblet of brandy, and
then sat staring at his boots.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Lamia Leegh entered the stateroom. He
looked up at her stupidly. His face was flushed, his eyes
were fishy. The air was full of the smell of brandy. She
knew that he had been drinking to intoxication; but she
cared too little for him and too much for herself to notice
this. He might drink himself to death, if he pleased, without
any interference from her, so that he supplied her with
plenty of money while he lived and left her a rich dower
when he should die.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, without seeming to notice his state, she sat down on
the sofa by him and said, very pleasantly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You remember hearing me speak of that interesting
young woman from the Samaritan Hospital for whom we
furnished an outfit and engaged a stateroom in this cabin
to send her home to her people?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What young woman? Ah! yes, I believe I do. What of
her?” he drawled, with assumed indifference.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have just seen her and her child——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Child?” he echoed involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I told you she had a child, you remember.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw—no—I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. Such a pretty little girl baby! They have
been shut up in their stateroom for a week on account of
the mother’s seasickness. She is out on deck to-day for the
first time. When I saw a new face there I thought it was
hers, but was not certain, so I passed her by. But a little
later, when I saw the stewardess place a young infant in
her arms, then I felt almost certain, and I went up and
spoke to her. A prodigal daughter, I fear she is, but a most
interesting one, and her father is to meet her at Liverpool
and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lamia,” interrupted the man, “suppose we drop the
subject. I am not at all interested in your charity girl.”
He yawned with a bored air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very well; what shall we talk about? The end of
the voyage? Well, I heard the captain say that we shall
be at Queenstown to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we shall get off at Queenstown; do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“At Queenstown? But why, when our tickets are for
Liverpool?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I will it to be so!” said the man, in the sullen
wilfulness of intoxication.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very well! Quite right! So be it!” replied Lamia,
with contemptuous submission.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the discussion ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>She loosened her dress and laid herself down on the
lower berth to take an afternoon nap.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sat on the sofa, with the brandy bottle before him,
and drank and drank and drank.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening Gentleman Geff was much too drunk to go
into the dining saloon, yet with the fatuity of drunkenness
he insisted on doing so, and he reeled out of his stateroom
and through the cabin and up the stairs. But had it
not been for Lamia’s strong support he could never have
reached his seat at their table. Lamia was like Burns’
Nanny:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A handsome jaud and strang,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and she succeeded in setting him safe in his seat, where he
sat bloated, blear-eyed, and luckily stupid, instead of hilarious
or quarrelsome. Every one at table noticed his condition,
and—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a pity! What a pity!” was thought or whispered
by one or another.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a severe ordeal for Lamia, yet the trial was softened
by the thought that all the sympathies of the company
were with her, all the condemnation for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was glad at last when she succeeded in drawing him
away from the table to the privacy of their stateroom, where
he fell upon the sofa and sank into the heavy sleep of intoxication.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia felt too bitterly humiliated to return to the saloon
or go on deck, so she remained in the stateroom, reading a
French book until it was time to retire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she turned into her berth, leaving the stupefied
inebriate to sleep off the fumes of his brandy, lying on the
sofa dressed as he was.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie Montgomery sat on deck with her baby on her
knees until the fading day and the freshening breeze warned
her to seek shelter in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Then she took her child to her stateroom, where soon
after both were rocked to sleep by the rolling of the ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a dark night, partly overclouded, and with but
few stars shining.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few passengers, all men, remained on deck to catch the
first glimpse of land. Before midnight the man on the
lookout made Cape Clear Lighthouse, and the ship ran
along the coast of Ireland.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='large'>FATHER AND DAUGHTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jennie slept late that morning, and was finally awakened
by the cessation of the motion to which she had been accustomed
day and night for the last nine days.</p>

<p class='c009'>She started up and looked out.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ship was at anchor in the fine cove of Cork, and the
window of her stateroom commanded the harbor. She knew
there was a crowd of people on deck, but she felt no disposition
to join them; so after she had washed and
dressed her child and herself she sat down and waited until
the kind stewardess brought her some breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here we are at Queenstown,” said the good woman,
as she set down the breakfast tray.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you for bringing my breakfast, Mrs. Hopkins.
How long will we remain here?” inquired Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only a few hours. The bride and groom—Mr. and Mrs.
Randolph Hay, you know—have got off. I know they took
their tickets for Liverpool, and here they have got off at
Queenstown. Now they will go to London by way of Holyhead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah,” said Jennie, only because she felt that she must say
something.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very queer, I call it, for gentlemen and ladies to sacrifice
their passage money in that way. But when people have
more money than they know what to do with they do fling
a good deal away, that’s certain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie began to drink her coffee to avoid the necessity of
speaking. She did not think it was queer that the pair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>should have left the steamer at Queenstown, for she understood
very well that Kightly Montgomery dared not face her
father at Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they really off, Mrs. Hopkins?” she inquired at last.
“Are you sure they have actually gone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Went ashore in the boat half an hour ago. Took all
their baggage from the stateroom, but left that which is in
the hold—big trunks that must go to Liverpool, where they
will claim them at the custom house, when they themselves
get there by the mail route,” replied the stewardess.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a great relief to Jennie. To know that Kightly
Montgomery was really gone from the steamer, not to
return, gave her a sense of freedom and security which she
had not experienced since she had discovered his baleful
presence on board. She felt now that she could go freely on
the deck and take her child there, and enjoy all the delights
of the voyage across the channel and up the Mersey, without
the fear of meeting him or his deceived bride.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think, Mrs. Hopkins, that I shall trouble any
one to bring my meals to me here after this. I shall go to
the public table,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be much better for you, my dear,” the stewardess
replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now that I have finished breakfast, I will take baby
and go up on deck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be better for you, too, my dear. Let me help
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no. I am quite well and ever so much stronger than
I was yesterday. Besides, the ship is quite still, so you see
I can walk steadily and carry baby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the stewardess resolutely took the child from the
arms of the young mother and carried it up before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The deck was a crowded and busy scene. All the passengers
were up there, gazing out upon the beautiful
scenery. But crowded as it was, the people were nearly all
standing, so it was easy for the stewardess to find a good
seat for the mother, to whom, when comfortably arranged,
she gave the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her fellow passengers took but little notice of Jennie
now; they were too much interested in other matters. She
sat there and enjoyed the scene until the ship got under
way again and stood out for the mouth of the Mersey.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>This last day on board Jennie enjoyed the voyage very
much. She spent nearly the whole day on deck, and left it
with reluctance at night to retire to her stateroom. That
night she could scarcely sleep for the excitement of anticipating
her meeting with her father.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, she was up and out on deck early the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were near the mouth of the Mersey. As soon as she
had breakfasted she packed up all her effects, so as to be
ready to go on shore as soon as the ship should land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she sat on deck to watch the shores until at last
the steamer drew near to the great English seaport and
came to anchor.</p>

<p class='c009'>A steam tender from the piers was rapidly approaching
the <em>Scorpio</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A great crowd of people were on board the tender, apparently
coming to meet friends on the <em>Scorpio</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many field glasses were in active use in the hands of voyagers
trying to make out the persons of their friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie had no glass, but as she stood bending forward,
straining her eyes to see, a gentleman near her said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you take my glass?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She thanked him, and took it, adjusted the lenses to her
sight, and held the instrument up to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>A cry of joy had nearly broken from her lips. She saw
her father standing on the deck of the coming tender, looking
well and happy. He, too, had a glass, and was using it.
She saw that he had seen her; he took off his hat and
waved it to her. She waved her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tender was drawing very near, and now came a general
waving of handkerchiefs in salutation from the passengers
on both steamers.</p>

<p class='c009'>In another minute the tender was alongside, the gangplank
thrown down, and the rush of friends to meet each
other made a joyous confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie found herself in her father’s arms, scarcely knowing
how she got there in such a crowd and confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My daughter! my daughter! welcome! welcome! welcome!
welcome to my heart!” the father cried, in a breaking,
choking voice, as he pressed her fondly to his breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My own beloved father! Oh, thank the Lord—thank
the Lord, that I see you again! And my mother!—my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>darling mother!—how is she?” cried Jennie, sobbing for
joy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dearest, well, thank Heaven! Sends fondest
love to you, my child, and waits your return with a joyful
heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! how have I deserved this love and tenderness, this
divine compassion and forgiveness? Oh! my father, I
ought to fall—not on your neck—but at your feet, and say—what
I feel! what I feel!—‘Father, I have sinned against
Heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
called thy child.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! my darling, hush! We will talk later. Let us go
away from here as soon as possible. Where is your babe,
Jennie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In my stateroom, dear father, fast asleep. Will you
come down with me and see her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The father and daughter struggled through the pressing
crowd, and made their way slowly and with difficulty down
into the cabin, which was now all “upside down” with
ladies and ladies’ maids, and gentlemen and valets, stewards
and stewardesses, getting together their “traps” and making
ready to go on shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie took her father directly to her stateroom, where
the pretty babe lay sleeping on the lower berth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie lifted the babe and placed it in her father’s arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister received the child, raised his eyes, and
solemnly invoked God’s blessing on it, then stooped and
pressed a kiss upon its brow. Finally he returned the babe
to its mother, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wrap her up, my dear. We must hurry, or we shall
miss the first return trip of the tender and have to wait for
the second, which would cause us to lose our train.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie quickly folded the baby in the warm white cloak
and hood which had been given her by the Duncan children.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I will take her again and carry her for you. Do
you take up your hand-bag and parasol. I will speak to
have the other things brought after us,” said Mr. Campbell,
as he led the way to the deck, carrying the babe, and followed
by his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The passengers had all left the steamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Men were carrying baggage on board the tender. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Campbell spoke to one of them, directing him to the stateroom
of his daughter. Then, holding the babe on one arm,
he gave the other to Jennie, and led her across the gangplank
and on board the tender, where by this time all the
passengers were gathered.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few minutes the tender put off from the ship and
steamed to the piers, where she soon arrived. The passengers
swarmed out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell called a cab, put his daughter and her
child into it, followed them and gave the order: To the
Lime Street Railway Station.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached the place the minister stopped the
cab, got out and took the babe from her mother’s arms,
and led the way into a second-class waiting-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will stay here, my dear,” he said, “while I go back
to the custom house and get your baggage through. You
will not mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, dearest father. I shall not mind anything, except
missing the sight of your dear face, even for a minute.
It seems to me as if I should never bear to lose sight of you
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall come back as soon as possible, my dear,” said the
minister; and he found for her a comfortable seat, placed
the baby in her arms, and so left her in the waiting-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie sat there without feeling the time pass wearily,
after all; her mind was too full of delightful anticipations
of homegoing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nearly an hour passed, and then her father came hurrying
in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is all done, my dear. Your trunks are rescued from
the custom house and deposited on the train, and now we
have five minutes left in which to take some refreshments,
if you would like,” he said cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want nothing, dear papa, for I have not very long since
breakfasted. But you?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear; nothing for me. And now, my dear child, I
have at length found breathing space in this hurry and confusion
to ask about your husband. You did not name him
at all in your letter, from which I argued ill; and if there
had been time, I should have written to you for some explanation;
but I knew that you were then to sail in a few
days, and that you would reach Liverpool before my letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>could get to New York. Now, my dear, I must ask you
some very serious questions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is it that you, the daughter of a clergyman of the
Church of England, and the wife of an ex-captain in her
majesty’s army, should have been confined in the charity
ward of a public hospital?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie shuddered, but did not answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How was it that you had to be indebted to alms for your
outfit and passage to this country? Why did you not mention
your husband’s name in your letter to me? Why are
you here alone? Where is your husband? Tell me, child.
Do not fear or hesitate to tell your father everything,” he
said, tenderly taking her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa, your goodness goes to my heart. He has left
me, papa,” she said, and then suddenly lifting her soft, dark
eyes, full of truth and candor, to meet her father’s pitying
gaze, she added: “But do not mind that, dear papa. I do
not. The best thing he ever did for me was to leave me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa dear, it was, indeed. I am not saying this
from pride or bravado, but because it is the very truth itself,
that the best thing he ever did for me was to leave me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jennie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do not care for him, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet, my child, he is your husband still,” said the
minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unhappily, yes; but he has left me. It is the kindest
act of his life toward me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you never wish to see him again, Jennie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never, nor to hear of him. I am happy now in a quiet
way. I wish for nothing better on earth than to live in a
quiet way at the darling little parsonage with you and dearest
mamma and my blessed baby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly into the pathos and gravity of Jennie’s face
came a ripple of humor as she spoke of her child and looked
at her father.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rev. James Campbell was certainly the youngest
grandfather in England, if not in Europe. He was really
but thirty-eight years old, and might have been taken for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>a mere boy, for he was of medium height and of slight and
elegant form, with a shapely head, pure, clean-cut classic
features, a clear, fair complexion and dark chestnut hair,
parted in the middle, cut rather short and slightly curling.
He wore neither beard nor mustache. His dress was a
clerical suit of black cloth of the cheapest quality and somewhat
threadbare; but it perfectly fitted his faultless figure;
but his linen collar and cuffs were spotless even after a
railway journey in the second-class cars and his gloves were
neatly mended.</p>

<p class='c009'>Altogether he looked very young and even boyish, as we
said, though he was in middle life and a grandfather.</p>

<p class='c009'>But for the close resemblance between the father and
daughter, their fellow passengers in the waiting-room must
have taken them for a married pair, and “o’er young to
marry also.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But about this man, Jennie,” he said, seeing that she
paused. “Where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Ireland, I believe, papa. It is a long story I have to
tell when we get home. And—here is our train.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The whistle sounded, and the minister took his grandchild
from his daughter and carried it, followed by its
mother, to their seats in one of the second-class carriages.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='large'>HER WELCOME HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The curate and his daughter found themselves in a
crowded carriage of the second class, on the Great Northern
express train from Liverpool to Glasgow. I say crowded,
for though no one was standing up, yet many of the passengers
had well-grown children on their laps.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell and Jennie took the last two vacant seats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me the baby now, papa dear,” said the little
mother, holding opt her arms, as soon as she had settled
herself in her seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear, the child is sleeping. If she wakes and frets,
I will hand her over to you; otherwise I will hold her to
rest you,” replied her father.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Their fellow travelers turned and looked at the young
grandfather and the youthful mother, and very naturally
drew false conclusions.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were mostly of the class who listen, comment and
observe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s easy to see that is a young married pair, with their
first child,” whispered a fat, florid country woman, with one
baby sitting on her knees and two on the floor at her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He won’t be quite so fond of loading himself down with,
the kids when there’s a dozen of ’em, maybe,” replied her
companion, a stout, brown woman with a burden of two
heavy bundles and a basket on and about her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister and his daughter heard every word of this
whispered colloquy with slight smiles of amusement; but
it warned them that they could not indulge in any very
confidential discourse there, where every whispered word could
be so distinctly heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>All further explanations would have to be postponed until
they should reach Medge Parsonage. And that was a hundred
miles off as yet. Nothing but the commonplaces of
conversation could pass between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you quite comfortable, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t feel the draught from that window?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, papa dear.” Etcetera.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie took particular pains to call her young father
“papa” whenever she spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But that did not enlighten their companions as to the
true relations between the two. They thought it only one
more silly affectation of the youthful parents. Many vain
young mothers called their husbands “papa” for baby, as
many proud young fathers called their wives “mamma” also
for baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>So merely trivial talk passed between the father and
daughter until the train blew the steam whistle and
“slowed” into the first station after leaving Liverpool,
stopped ten seconds and sped on again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie had not seen her native country for two years, and
she looked out at the vanishing station almost with the curiosity
of a stranger, and then exclaimed with a look of astonishment:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, papa! That was Huton!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“Well, my dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie looked at her father in amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter, my dear?” inquired the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Matter? Why, papa, matter enough. We have certainly
taken the wrong train. Huton is on the Great Northern,
and not the South Eastern Railroad. This is not the
way to Medge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, dear, we are not going to Medge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not going to Medge?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie stared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I also have something to tell you which I have reserved
until now,” said the minister gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, papa? Oh, what is it?” demanded the
young girl in sudden alarm. “You said my dear mother
was quite well. If she were in heaven, you might say with
truth she was quite well; but oh! how could I bear it! Oh,
how could I bear it! Is she quite well in this world?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite well, here on earth, my dear. Compose yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then what is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing to alarm you, Jennie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are we going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Haymore, in the North Biding of Yorkshire, where
I have a curacy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Hay—— And you never told me!” said Jennie,
aghast with astonishment. All her life, until her hasty
marriage, two years before, she had lived with her parents
at Medge. She considered them as fixtures to that spot.
She would as soon have expected the old parish church
and graveyard to be plucked up by the roots from Medge
and transplanted to Haymore as to have her father and
mother removed from the first to the last named place.
“‘Haymore!’” she said to herself—“‘Haymore!’ Surely
that was the name of the manor to which Kightly Montgomery
had fallen heir. And in Yorkshire, too. It must be
the same place! She and her father were going there!
And—Kightly Montgomery, under his new name, and with
his new bride, was also going there. The first as the lord
of the manor, the second as pastor of the parish. What
was to be done? They must surely meet, and then?”
Jennie was dumfounded from consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“Why, what ails you, Jennie, my child?” inquired her
father.</p>

<p class='c009'>She found her tongue at last, and said, because she did
not know what else to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You never told me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I explained that I reserved the information for our
meeting,” gently replied the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long have you been at Haymore?” was her next
question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About twelve weeks. Not quite three months. But
don’t look so horrified, my dear. If I had changed my
religion, instead of having changed my parish, you could
scarcely seem more confounded,” said the curate, with a
little laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa dear, what made you leave dear old Medge?”
she dolefully inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Necessity, Jennie. My old rector died——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Good old Dr. Twomby! Has he gone?” exclaimed
Jennie in a tone of grief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear—full of years and honors. It would be impious
to mourn the departure of so sainted a man. His
successor was a young Oxonian, who gave me warning and
put in a classmate of his own as his curate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what made you go so far—quite from the south to
the north of England?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Again necessity, my dear. I was out of employment,
and your mother and myself were living in cheap lodgings
in the village, when I received a letter from Dr. Orton—an
old friend of my father, who had heard of my misfortune—inviting
me to come with my wife to Haymore and take
his parish and occupy his parsonage for a year, during
which he was ordered by his physician to travel for his
health. I gratefully accepted the offer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how do you like it, papa?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very much, my dear. The rectory is a beautiful old
house, very conveniently fitted with all modern improvements
and very comfortably furnished. The house is covered
with ivy and the porches with climbing plants. There
is a luxuriant old garden, full of flowers and herbs and
all kinds of fruits and vegetables that our climate will grow,
and there is a lawn with old oak trees.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“How lovely!” impulsively exclaimed Jennie. But then
her face fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it is lovely,” assented the minister, who had not
noticed the change in his child’s countenance. “And I like
it so well that I shall grieve to leave it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but you are sure of it for a twelvemonth!” exclaimed
Jennie, eager to please her father, yet again stopping
short at the sudden memory of what must meet him
at Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, my dear. I am not sure of the place for a
month even. Orton has heart disease, and, though he may
live for months or years, he may drop dead at any moment.
He may be dead now. And in such a case, you see, the
very same thing that happened to me at Medge would
happen again at Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How, papa?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If Orton should die, his successor would turn me adrift,
to put in my place some friend of his own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who has the appointing of the incumbent? The bishop
of the diocese or some nobleman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither. The living is attached to Haymore Manor, and
is in the gift of the new squire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the gift of the new squire, and that squire Kightly
Montgomery under a new name!</p>

<p class='c009'>The thought of this complication turned Jennie pale. In
her dismay and confusion, she could settle upon but one
course—the course she had thought of all along—to tell her
father everything; every single fact she knew concerning
Kightly Montgomery.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister was now watching her curiously, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>To cover her distress, she asked the first question that
came into her head, and not an irrelevant one:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were the terms favorable upon which you agreed to
take this parish for a year, papa?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes, I suppose so. The living is worth six hundred
pounds a year, and Orton gives me two hundred, with
the use of the rectory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you do all the work for one-third of the salary?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my dear; and I am very glad to do it. And there
are hundreds of capable clergymen in England who would
be glad to do it for one-sixth of the salary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Mr. Campbell suddenly became conscious that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>was talking too freely of private matters in a crowded car.
He looked about him. But every one seemed too sleepy to
attend to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman with the three babies was sound asleep, as
was her brood, and the group reminded the curate of a fat,
cozy pussy cat and her kittens.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman with the bundles was nodding, catching herself,
gripping her parcels and nodding again.</p>

<p class='c009'>These were the nearest passengers to the curate and his
daughter, and had evidently not been listening to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The express had been running on a long while without
stopping, but now, about noon, the steam horn shrieked
again and the train drew into the station of a large
manufacturing town, stopped two minutes and roared on again.</p>

<p class='c009'>The swift motion of the train, that sent nearly all the
grown people to nodding and all the children to sleep,
seemed to have so overpowered the nerves of Jennie’s young
baby as to steep it into a deep stupor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little mother at length grew anxious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you think baby sleeps too soundly, papa?” she
inquired uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, my dear! She is all right. She will sleep
until we get home and then wake up as bright as a daisy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten minutes for refreshments!” shouted the guard at
the window, as he climbed along on the outside of the carriage,
while the train drew into the station of another large
town.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you get out, Jennie?” inquired her father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No papa dear, I would much rather not,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then take the baby while I go,” he said, carefully
placing the little one on her lap within her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, what shall I bring you, dear?” he next inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A cup of tea and a biscuit, papa, nothing more,” replied
Jennie, who remembered the slender purse of the curate,
who could ill afford the journey to Liverpool and back with
his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had ten pounds left of her own, but did not dare to
offer them to her father, whose very poverty made him sensitive.
She meant, however, when she should reach the parsonage,
to put that little fund, through her mother’s agency,
into the general household expenses.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Mr. Campbell left the carriage and went across to the
refreshment rooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie’s fellow passengers of the second class did not
leave their seats, but took out luncheon baskets, and soon the
air was full of the sound of popping ginger beer or ale or
porter bottles, while bread and cheese and beef were laid out
on laps covered with brown wrapping paper for a tablecloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman with the babies and the woman with the bundles,
who sat opposite to Jennie and seemed to be friends,
drew the cork of brown stout—one holding the bottle, and
the other pulling the screw with all her might.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the mother filled a little thick glass tumbler with
the foaming porter and held it to Jennie, saying kindly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drink it, dearie. It’ll do ’ee good; ’specially as ye’re
nussing a young babe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie, touched by the kindness, smiled her sweetest and
thanked her neighbor, explaining that her heart was weak
and that she could not bear strong porter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I hope your good man will bring ’ee some light
wine,” replied the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gentleman with me is my father,” said Jennie, glad
to make this explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your fey—— And the grandfeyther o’ the bairn?”
exclaimed the woman, opening her eyes with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s wonderful! He didn’t look a day over twenty-five.
Do he, now, M’riah?” she said, appealing to her companion
of the bundles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He don’t that,” replied the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>But here the three babies became clamorous for something
to eat, and the two women turned their attention to
them. And though this party had been nibbling cake or
candy, more or less, during the whole journey, as is too
much the custom of their class, yet now they all ate as if
they had fasted since breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell reappeared with a little tray in his hand,
on which was arranged a cup of tea, a small plate of cream
toast, and another plate with the wing of a roast chicken,
which he placed on the vacant seat, while he relieved Jennie
of her sleeping babe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear papa, to think that you should remember my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>taste for milk toast and chicken, and bring them to me!
This is killing the fatted calf, indeed,” said Jennie gratefully
as she took the tray upon her lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell then sat down on the vacant seat with the
baby in his arms; but he made no reply except by a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train started.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear,” said Jennie, “we are carrying off the crockery
ware!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all,” replied the father. “The return train will
bring them back and leave them at this station. Such is the
arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then my mind is easy. Did you get anything to eat,
papa dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; a slice of cold beef and a cup of coffee while
they were fixing up your tray.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad,” said Jennie; and she gave her attention to
her tray, and exhibited such a healthy appetite that not a
crumb or a drop was left when she finished her meal and
put the little service under the seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train rushed on, nor stopped again until nearly sunset,
when it ran in at the station of York.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the father and daughter got off to take a branch line
to Chuxton, the nearest railway station to Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Willingly would the curate have stayed here overnight to
show his daughter the great cathedral city, which she had
never seen, had not two good reasons prevented—first, his
poverty, which could not bear the expense; secondly, the
anxiety of the wife and mother at home to see her long-absent
daughter, which, he knew, could not tolerate the delay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some day we will return to see this ancient city, my
dear; but to-day we must hurry home to your mother,” he
said as he led her into the waiting-room to stay till their
train should be ready to start.</p>

<p class='c009'>There the “little angel” awoke in no angelic temper, but
impatient to be nursed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie took her into the dressing-room, where she attended
to all her needs, and presently brought her back
smiling and good-natured to the arms of her grandfather.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I foresee what an idol the grandmother will make of
this little one,” he said as he received her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The idea of calling my pretty young mamma a grandmother!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>It is well she is not a woman of fashion, or she
would be disgusted,” said Jennie, laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As it is, she will be delighted,” said her father, looking
curiously at his child. He was very pleasantly disappointed
in Jennie. He had feared to meet in her a heartbroken
woman—a forsaken wife, whom none of her “old blessings”
of father and mother, home and family affection, could possibly
console—and he found a daughter who had let go the
unfaithful husband and comforted herself with her unoffending
babe, and meant even to enjoy herself with her
parents at the parsonage in the performance of every filial,
maternal and domestic duty. And that this disposition was
not forced, but was natural, might be seen and heard in her
contented countenance and frequent laugh. Even now, if
the thought would recur that the curate’s temporary parish
lay in the manor of Haymore, and the reigning or pretending
squire was Kightly Montgomery, still, upon later reflection,
she felt so much confidence in the wisdom and
goodness of her father that she dismissed all dread of any
fatal or even serious result of his meeting with her husband.
And for one circumstance Jennie felt glad and grateful,
namely, for the change of residence from Medge, where
everybody had known her from childhood, and might, therefore,
wonder and ask questions why the curate’s married
daughter should return home to live without her husband—since
it was clear from her dress that she was not a
widow.</p>

<p class='c009'>No such wonder could be excited at Haymore; no such
questions asked. The people were strangers. They had
taken their temporary pastor upon well-merited trust, and
his family history was unknown to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the other matter connected with Kightly Montgomery,
she would tell her father everything, and he would
know what to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kightly Montgomery, she knew, never by any chance entered
a church, so her father would never see him there.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the curate, when she should have told him who
the new squire really was, it was unlikely that Mr. Campbell
would feel disposed to make a clerical call at the manor
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the divine Providence she would leave everything
to her father.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>While the father and daughter were still chatting pleasantly
together a door was flung open and a voice was heard
announcing:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Train for Chuxton.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my child,” said Mr. Campbell, rising with the
baby on his arms and crossing the room, followed by Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went out to the train and entered the second-class
carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>In five minutes, after they were comfortably seated, the
train was off, speeding away from the old cathedral city in
a northerly direction across the moors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun had not yet set, though it was on the edge of the
horizon. Jennie fixed her eyes on the vastness of the brown
moor that stretched, or rather rolled, away in all directions
to meet the horizon. It reminded her of the sea. It seemed
a boundless ocean, enchanted into stillness; for not a breath
of air disturbed the motionless heather, and not a hamlet or
a farmhouse broke the illusion. No doubt there were farms
and villages not far off, but they were in the hollows, out
of sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Jennie turned from the window to look at her
baby. The little one was fast asleep again; so was the
curate, who had been traveling all night and all day, for
twenty-four hours. He had his arms so securely wound
around the sleeping child that Jennie forbore to take it
away, lest she should disturb their rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun set; twilight faded; yet the train sped on over
the moor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Jennie observed twinkling lights before her
that seemed to be on the edge of the horizon. As the train
sped on toward those lights she recognized them as belonging
to a station.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the steam horn shrieked and waked up all the passengers,
and the guide shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chuxton!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are, my dear,” said the curate, waking up as
the train stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were but few passengers who got out here, and
there were all sorts of conveyances waiting for them, from
donkey carts to fine coaches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far are we from Haymore, papa?” inquired Jennie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>as her father led her from the train to the waiting-room
of the station.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten miles, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there a stagecoach to Haymore?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear, but I took the precaution to engage the
fly from the Red Fox to meet us here for this train. If it
has not come yet—and I do not see it—it will be here soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much expense I put you to, dear papa!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut, tut! there is a time to spend! Whether there is
a time to save or not, while there is the least need anywhere
of spending, I really do not know! There’s the fly
now!” exclaimed the curate, at the sound of wheels, suddenly
breaking off in his discourse and going to the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Nahum, you are on time, I see!” said Mr. Campbell,
speaking cheerfully to some one in the outer darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, bound to be, sir, when your reverence had bespoken
the kerridge,” answered a buoyant voice from the shades.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my dear! But, Nahum, perhaps the mule wants
food and water?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not she, sir! She had her oats and her water and her
mug of ale! You’d no believe, sir, how that lass loves ale!
So, with your leave, I’ll e’en give her another mug of that
same, whiles she rests five minutes. No longer, your reverence.
No longer, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right. Let us know when you are ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate sat down by his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>In something less than five minutes the voice of the hostler
was heard, calling:</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right now, sir. Miss Nancy and me is at your service,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Nancy?” inquired Jennie as she arose and took
her father’s arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This mule, of course. Nahum is an oddity! His avocations
are multiform. He is coachman, groom, hostler and
handy man generally at the Red Fox,” Mr. Campbell explained
as he took his daughter out to the carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not a “fly” at all, though they called it so; it was
a strong, snug carryall, covered all over with a black tarpaulin,
except the front, which was open. It was drawn by a
stout mule.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell put his daughter and her child in the sheltered
back seat and placed himself beside the coachman in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the front. And the carryall rolled away over the murky
moor until it seemed to be swallowed up in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>But “Miss Nancy” knew the road, and, if she had not
known it, her driver did. So they went on in safety.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='large'>STARTLING NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nahum opened conversation with Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The last of the workmen have left to-day, sir,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The workmen? Oh, the decorators and upholsterers
who were fitting up Haymore Hold for the young squire and
his bride.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. All is finished in the very latest style, and
with all the modernest improvements. And they do say as
there is not a place in the North Riding aquil to it for
magnificence and splendiferousness! They do that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, when are the young pair expected?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That I can’t jest tell you, sir. But Mr. Isaiah Prowt,
the bailiff, do say as he is to receive a week’s notice of their
arrival, so as to have the triumphanting arches put up all
along the road leading into the village and the avenue from
the park gate to the hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will make a fine display, Nahum, but an expensive
one. However, I suppose it will give pleasure to the
people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will that, your reverence. And that is not all! They
are to have tents and markees and pavilions all over the
lawn, and a great outdoor gala for all the tenants, and even
the villagers who are not tenants, and for the whole neighborhood;
in fact, men, women, and children, sir, are to be
feasted on the fat of the land, and have dances and games,
and all that, all day long, and at night fireworks! All at
the young squire’s expense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be a boon to the village, where there is never
even a market day or a fair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will that, sir. Why, the people have gone stark, staring
mad over the very thought of it, though they don’t the
least know when it is to come off. But they are looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>forrid to it. For, as you say, sir, they never have anything
here. Chuxton is the market town, and the fairs go
there on market day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So they never have a public fête unless it is given by the
lord of the manor on the occasion of a marriage, or a coming
of age in the family?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And never then, up to this toime. Such a day as this
coming on has never been seen at Haymore in the memory
of man. The old squires never did nothing like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No? Why was that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they kept themselves aloof. They never thought
about their tenants, except to keep them pretty strict and
punctuous in the payment of the rents. Otherwise they
looked down on them as dirt underneath of their feet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us hope, from the present signs, that the new squire
will be more genial and benevolent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He will that, sir. You may depend upon it. And no
doubt he will have the old church repaired. And you’ll do
your part to welcome the bridal pair. You’ll have the
parish school children drilled to stand aich side the road by
which they come and sing songs and throw flowers? And
you’ll have the bellringers to ring out joyful peals of
music?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, certainly, with all my heart. It falls in the
way of my office to see that the parish school children and
the bellringers take their part and do their duties properly
in the ceremonial reception of the bridal couple,” cordially
responded Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>No more was said just then.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie was aghast. She had not thought that Kightly
Montgomery would bring his deceived bride, who was not a
lawful wife, to England so soon after his <i><span lang="fr">rencontre</span></i> with herself
on shipboard. When he had left the steamer at Queenstown,
to avoid meeting her father at Liverpool, she had
supposed that he would go to the continent for his bridal
tour, and return later to England. But instead of doing so
he had written a letter from Queenstown, on the morning
of his arrival there, to announce his intention of coming to
Haymore. This letter he must have posted on the same
morning, so that it came over land and sea by the shorter
route of the Irish mail, and reached its destination at Haymore
before she, by the longer way of the channel, arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>at Liverpool. But why did he think of coming to Haymore
at this time?</p>

<p class='c009'>A little reflection told her why. She tried to put herself
in Kightly Montgomery’s place and think out his motives.
Then she understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kightly Montgomery knew certainly that Jennie had
gone home to her father’s, but he believed, erroneously, that
she had gone to him in his old parish at Medge, in Hantz,
where the curate had lived and preached for twenty years
past, and where he was likely to continue to minister for
forty years to come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nearly the whole length of England lay between Medge,
on the south coast of Hantz, and Haymore, in the North
Riding of Yorkshire. He might, therefore, go safely to his
manor house without fear of being troubled by Jennie or
her people. He could not dream, of course, that the Rev.
James Campbell had left Medge to become the pastor of the
parish of Haymore, where his daughter would be with him;
else he would as soon have rushed into a burning furnace
as to come to Yorkshire.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far Jennie reasoned out correctly the meaning of
Kightly Montgomery’s course. But there was more cause
for his false sense of security than she knew anything about.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kightly Montgomery had not the least idea that Jennie,
by putting odds and ends of facts and probabilities together,
had made herself acquainted with his fraudulent claim to
the name of Hay, and to the inheritance of Haymore. He
thought she knew nothing beyond the fact of his second
marriage, not even the name under which he married, and
that, therefore, she could not know how or where to seek
him, even if she were disposed to do so, which he utterly
disbelieved. With his wronged wife at the extreme south of
England, and in ignorance of his present name and residence,
he felt perfectly safe in coming to Haymore in the
north, to gratify his pride and vanity by a triumphant
entry, with his queenly and beautiful bride, into the village
and on to the manor house.</p>

<p class='c009'>He little dreamed of the dread Nemesis awaiting him
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie, my darling, why are you so silent?” inquired
Mr. Campbell, breaking in upon his daughter’s reverie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been listening, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“But you have not heard anything for the last half hour.
We have not been talking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I listened with a great deal of interest while you did
talk, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you have heard that in a few days, perhaps, we
are going to have grand doings at Haymore to welcome the
young squire and his bride.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa dear, I heard all that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it will be a very exciting time,” evasively replied
the young woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie, my dear, you speak so faintly. Are you tired?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa dear—rather tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take courage, then, for we are near home, where the
mother is waiting to welcome us with a bright fire and a
nice tea table,” said the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa. Don’t mind me, dear. It is a healthful
weariness that will make me sleep all the better,” replied
Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the last words were fairly jolted out of her mouth,
for the carryall was now ascending a very steep hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate turned his head again to speak to his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are entering the village, dear, and the church and
parsonage are at this end. You can see nothing from where
you sit behind there. If you could you would see a stony
road, with paving stones set sharp edge up to make a hold
for horses’ hoofs, otherwise they could scarcely climb it
And you would see high stone walls on each side of the road,
with plantations behind them. These walls, my dear, inclose
Haymore Park, through a portion of which this road
runs. On the top of the hill is Haymore Old Church and
Rectory. There is our home at present. There is an old
graveyard around the church, and an old garden around
the rectory. All this is at the entrance of the village, which
stretches on both sides of the road over the hill and down
the declivity. All around the manor, the church and the
village roll the everlasting moors from the center to the
circumference. There, my dear, you have a picture of our
home, though you cannot see it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see it in my mind’s eye, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>All this time the mule was toiling slowly, painfully up
the steep ascent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie, straining her eyes to look forward, saw nothing
for a while but the black forms of her father and the driver
against the darkness, but presently fitful lights glanced in
sight and disappeared. After a while they grew more steady
and stationary, and Jennie recognized</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The lights in the village,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>though they were still distant before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are,” said the curate blithely as the panting
mule drew up before a gate in a wall, all covered with ivy
or some other creeping plant, Jennie could not see what.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond the gate and the wall was the front of a two-story,
double stone house, like the wall, all covered with
creeping vines, but with a bright firelight and lamplight
gleaming redly from the windows of the lower room on the
right-hand side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate lifted his daughter and her child from the
carryall and opened the gate that led between two low stone
walls, also covered with green creepers, up to the steps of
the long porch before the house. But some one in the house
had heard the sound of wheels, for the front door was flung
open, a small, slender woman rushed out and threw herself,
sobbing, into the arms of Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my darling! my darling! my darling!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, mother! mother! mother!”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all they could say, as they clasped each other,
sobbing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell went on before them into the house, carrying
the baby out of the night air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in, come in, come in! Oh, welcome home, my
child! my child!” sobbed the mother, as, with her arm
around the waist of her daughter, she supported her into the
house, through the hall and into that warm, bright room,
where a sea coal fire was blazing in the grate, and a chandelier
hung from the ceiling just over a dainty white cloth
that covered the tea table, on which a pretty china service
was arranged.</p>

<p class='c009'>The parlor was furnished entirely in crimson—carpet,
curtains, chair and sofa covers were all crimson, which, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the lamplight and firelight, gave a very warm, bright glow
to the room, which the travelers had seen from the carryall
without.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie was placed in an easy-chair, and her fur-lined
cloak and beaver hat taken off her by gentle mother hands.
Even in that sacred moment of meeting, the feminine instinct
caused the curate’s wife to hold up and admire the
rich cloak and hat that had been given Jennie by her New
York friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t looked at baby, mother dear,” said Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! so I haven’t! How could I forget!” exclaimed the
young grandmother; and down went cloak and hat, disregarded,
on the floor, while she turned to look for the little
queen who was destined to ascend the throne of the household.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell, smiling at this impetuosity, placed the infant
in her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then—but I will spare my readers the rhapsodies
that ensued.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, everything else was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Nahum, the driver, remembered he had to collect his
fare, and so “made bold” to walk into the curate’s house,
and stand, hat in hand, at the parlor door. As he stood in
the full glare of the light, he appeared a little, sturdy,
muscular man, with a strange mixture of complexion; for
while his skin was swarthy and his short hair, stubby beard
and heavy eyebrows were as black as jet, his eyes were light
blue. But the most characteristic feature in his remarkable
face was his nose, which was large and turned up so that
his nostrils described a semicircle upward. It was a “mocking
nose,” of the most distinct type. He wore a suit of
coarse blue tweed, and carried a battered felt hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Nahum!” exclaimed the curate on catching sight
of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, your reverence, it is eight shillings, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Ah! Yes!” said the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the price was paid and the driver dismissed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Esther Campbell and her recovered daughter were now
seated close together on the crimson sofa, which was drawn
up on one side of the blazing fire. Esther had her grandchild
on her lap and her right arm around Jennie’s waist,
while Jennie’s head rested on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Come, Hetty, my love, we want our tea,” said the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Campbell put the baby in its mother’s arms and
rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Yorkshire woman of middle age, dressed in a blue
cheviot cloth skirt and a gay striped sack of many colors,
came in with the tea urn and put it on the table. She was
a stranger to Jennie, but she courtesied to the “master’s”
daughter, who returned her greeting with a smile and bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is our old servant, mamma?” inquired Jennie
when the new one had left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Julia? She married the greengrocer and left us
just before we left Medge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Julia was forty years old at least!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear, and the greengrocer was a widower of fifty
with all his children grown up, married and settled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good match for Julia, then!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excellent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Yorkshire woman re-entered the room, bringing in a
tray on which was arranged hot muffins, dried toast, broiled
chicken and fried ham, all of which she placed on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is our daughter, Mrs. Montgomery, whom we have
been expecting to see for so long a time, Elspeth,” said Mrs.
Campbell, speaking from her own genial nature and overflowing
happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elspeth courtesied again and smiled, but said nothing;
she was rather shy. She took the baby, however, when the
curate and his wife and daughter sat down to the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Esther Campbell looked a young, fair and pretty woman
as she presided over the tea urn. She was really thirty-five
years old, but did not look more than twenty-three. But,
then, she had always had excellent health, few family cares
and no sorrows, except in the marriage of her daughter, and
even that was a light one compared to what that wayward
daughter was made to suffer. She was a woman of medium
height and slender form, for she had escaped the malady of
fat to which women of middle age or those approaching
middle age are subjected. Her figure was girlish, her features
were delicate, her complexion very fair, with a faint
rose hue over cheeks and chin. Her hair was brown, bright
and curly. She wore her only Sunday’s dress, a dark green
silk with a little lace at the throat and wrists. It was put on
in honor of her daughter’s return.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The party of three waited on themselves and each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all were served Hetty Campbell would most eagerly
have asked her daughter:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is your husband?” but that she feared something
was very wrong with him and dared not question Jennie on
this subject in the presence of the new servant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie had a healthy young appetite, and ate heartily, to
the great comfort of her mother, who joyously watched her
plate and kept it well supplied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you like this place, mamma?” inquired Jennie at
length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my dear, on many accounts I like it very much.
Of course we felt a natural regret at leaving a home where
we had lived so long that we seemed grown into it, like a
cluster of oysters in their shells, which to shuck out is death.
But as it was not our own act there was no compunction;
and as it was inevitable, there had to be resignation. We
are happy here, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the old friends—the people papa has christened and
married and comforted and instructed for twenty years!
For he was there before you were married, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it was hard to leave them. But the knowledge that
we must submit to the inevitable strengthened us even for
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how do you like the people here, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very much, indeed. They are exceedingly kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Elspeth having set the baby in its mother’s lap, and left
the room to take a new supply of hot muffins from the oven,
Jennie lowered her voice and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the one humble woman among the people with
whom we are in daily intercourse, and on whom so much
of our comfort must depend, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean our new servant?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course. Is she a worthy successor to Julia?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A most worthy one. Elspeth—the widow Longman—has
not always been in service. She has had reverses and
great sorrows—the loss of her husband while she was still
a young woman with an infant boy, a boy whom she spoiled
as only a widowed mother can spoil an only child. He grew
up, so it is said, not really wicked or worthless, but idle,
wilful, headstrong, and fond of pleasure and of roving.
One day the poor mother lost her temper, under some great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>provocation, and told him he was the one grief and trial of
her life, or words to that effect. He took his hat and walked
out of the house. She thought he had only gone to the barn
or to the village, and her burst of grief and anger being
over, she prepared that evening an extra good supper for
her boy, that they might make up their misunderstanding.
But, though she waited long and anxiously, he did not come,
nor has he ever come, nor has she ever heard one word of
him since that day when he walked out of the house in
sullen wrath.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how dreadful! how dreadful!” exclaimed Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; it nearly killed her. The farm, with no one to
look after it, went to rack and ruin. She was compelled to
sell off all the stock to pay the rent, and then to give up
the lease and go into service. That is Elspeth’s sad little
story,” said Mrs. Campbell, hurriedly concluding as she
saw the subject of her discourse re-entering the room with
the plate of hot muffins in hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>But no one wanted any more.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate gave thanks and they arose from the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mother and daughter reseated themselves on the
crimson sofa in the glow of the fire, Hetty Campbell took
the baby on her lap, and the fondling and idolizing recommenced,
and might have continued all night, but that
James Campbell wisely put an end to the play.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come!” he said. “I have been traveling night and day
for twenty-four hours, and am well worn out. So is Jennie,
though she has only traveled one day by rail. So we had
better go straight to bed. Listen, Hetty: I have had our
daughter all day long to myself. You take her to your
bosom to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh?” exclaimed his wife, not understanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you sleep with Jennie and the precious baby to-night.
That will make you all very happy, though I am not
so sure about the baby. Only don’t talk all night. Put off
all mutual explanations until the morning,” the curate explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie sprang to her father and embraced him, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa! how good of you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty, with the baby in her arms, came up on the other
side, kissed him, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“How kindly thoughtful of you, dear Jim!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! there! I shall not break my heart for your absence
this one night, Hetty, my dear. I shall sleep too
soundly. And the arrangement is on no account to be a
perpetual one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Elspeth, having cleared away the tea table, was called in,
and the evening worship was offered earlier than usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell in the course of his devotions prayed for
the safe return of the poor widow’s son. This he had always
done morning and evening since Elspeth had been living
with the family.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a great comfort to the poor mother, who one day
said to Mrs. Campbell:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No minister ever prayed for my poor lad to come back
before. Now the minister prays for him, I know he will
come. I see it a’ as plain as if my eyes were opened; the
maister’s prayer goes straight up to the Throne; the Lord
receives it, and sends its spirit straight down to my boy’s
heart, wherever he may be on the footstool; and he will feel
it a-drawing and a-drawing of him until he turns his steps
homeward. I know it! And, oh! mem, the one that kept
me from going crazy with the trouble was the thought that
go where he would, he wouldn’t get out of the Lord’s world;
and if I didn’t know where he was, the Lord did; and if I
couldn’t see him, the Lord could. So I prayed for him, and
by the Lord’s help kept up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the prayers were over the little family circle separated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elspeth went back to her kitchen to wash up her dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty and Jennie kissed the husband and father good-night
and went up to a spacious, white-draped chamber
which was over the parlor, and where a fine sea coal fire
was burning; and there they went to rest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='large'>IN THE SILVER MOON MINING CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was the close of a dark November day. Heavy mists
hung over the gulch and settled upon the mountain stream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>that ran between high banks at its bottom, and upon the
miners’ huts that dotted either side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The men had returned from their work and many of
them were seeking rest and refreshment in the shed dignified
with the name of saloon, where they paid very high
prices for very bad whisky, and won or lost money with very
grimy cards.</p>

<p class='c009'>One excuse for them was this—the camp was a new one,
far out of civilization. It had been called into existence by
the hue and cry of a new and grand discovery of ore in a
mine which the discoverers christened the Silver Moon. It
was formed mostly of men who had been unsuccessful in
other mines. And there was not a woman in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three men sat on the ground in the rudest of rude stone
huts, built up irregularly of small fragments of rocks, and
roofed with slender logs. There was neither door, window
nor chimney, but there was an opening in front, protected
by a buffalo hide—to keep the heat in, and there was a hole
in the roof to let the smoke out. The floor was the solid
earth, and the fire was built against the wall. There was
scarcely any furniture to be seen, only a heap of coarse
blankets in one corner, and an iron pot and a few tin cups
and plates in another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy’s well-ordered hut at Grizzly was a little palace
compared to this squalid shelter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three men sitting on the earth floor, before the fire,
which afforded the only light in the place, were unkempt,
unwashed and altogether about the roughest-looking savages
since the prehistoric ages. Yet they were three as different
men as could be found anywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first was perhaps the very tallest man ever seen outside
of a show, grandly proportioned, with a fine head, fine
face, clear, blue eyes, and yellow hair that flowed to his
shoulders, and a yellow beard that fell to his bosom. He
was clothed in a buckskin coat trimmed with fur, now much
the worse for wear, and buckskin leggings and buffalo-hide
boots. In a word, this Hercules was our old friend, Samson
Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second was a medium-sized and elderly man, with a
thin, red face, red beard and a bald head. He was clothed
in a coarse, gray shirt, duck trousers, a nondescript jacket,
and many wrappings of sackcloth and sage grass around his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>feet and ankles, by way of boots. He was our old acquaintance,
Andrew Quin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third was a slight yet muscular youth, with clear,
bright complexion, dark gray eyes and dark brown hair, a
mocking nose and a laughing mouth. He wore a coarse, red
flannel shirt, duck trousers, tucked into hide boots, a knit-woolen
blouse, and battered felt hat. Of course, he was
young Michael Man.</p>

<p class='c009'>All three of the men lived together like friends in this
hut. This evening they were all very grave, not to say
gloomy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Dandy Quin, sitting flat upon the ground and engaged
in unwinding the strips of sacking from his tired
feet, was the first to break a silence that had continued some
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m gettin’ tired of this yere,” he grumbled. “Here
we’ve been more’n two months working like mules, and
never got a gleam o’ this yere moonlight. It’s moon-calves
we are, all on us. Ef it hadn’t been for Longman and his
gun we’d ’a’ starved! that’s what we would—’a’ starved!
We never had no luck nowhere! Leastways, I never had!
I’ve been nigh twenty years slaving in the mines, digging in
the bowels of the yeth, working hard and living harder, and
running like a luny after a jack-o’-lantern, from one grand
discov’ry to another, but never got no more but hard work
and harder living out of any on ’em, and now I’m sixty
years old come next Martinmas, and I’m gettin’ tired on
it,” he concluded, flinging his rags aside and caressing his
poor feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy, ye poor ould craychur, haven’t ye pit a cint itself,
nowhere?” questioned Mike in a sympathetic tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, jest eleven hund’ed dollar in the savings bank at
Sacramento, and that I hev saved up, dollar be dollar, in
the last twenty years, a-working hard an’ the—Regiment hard, and
a-starving and a-stinting of meself to do it! And since here
we have come to this Silver Moon Mine it hev been all loss
and no gain! And as I said before, we’d ’a’ starved to
death ef it hadn’t been for Longman and his gun. And now
he is going back on us!” concluded Dandy in an injured
tone and with a look of reproach at the giant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should be sorry to do that,” said Longman, stroking
his long, yellow beard. “But, Dandy, why won’t you go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>with me? I will gladly take you. You are alone here and
growing old. Have you no natural longings to see your
native country? Come! come along with me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why can’t you stay here? How do you know but to-morrow
the stroke of a pick may strike a vein of solid
silver running down to the very middle of the earth?” demanded
Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, that’s it! Delusive hope has been the will-o’-the-wisp
that has led you on from post to pillar for twenty years
of unsuccess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, after working twenty years for almost nothing,
you wouldn’t have a man miss the chance of turning up a
fortune with the very next stroke of his pick—a fortune
that would pay him for all he has suffered—would you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, certainly not, if such luck were probable. But,
Dandy, my friend, your pick has never struck a vein, and I
think it never will. Be sensible. Draw your money from
the savings bank, and come home to England with me.
That sum will be a fortune to you in England, and set you
up in any light business you may like; or buy you a small
annuity, sufficient for your comforts for the rest of your
life. Think of it, Dandy,” said Longman, with kindly interest
in the lonely man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What makes you so hot-foot all of a sudden to go back
to England?” demanded Dandy. “A great, strapping, very
strapping young fellow like you to leave the grand field of
enterprise to go back to England?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman sighed and asked in his turn:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What brought you here, Dandy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I s’pose it was the goold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, man, the gold—the gold fever. I have nothing to
say against it, because it has, on the whole, enriched and
blessed the world; or, at least, I hope and believe so. But
you, to come out here to the gold country at forty years of
age, and to spend twenty years of life as hard as the life of
a convict, in the pursuit of an ignis-fatuus that always
eluded you, still under the delusion that the next stroke of
your pick may discover a vein, is to have lost so much of
your life! Think of what I have said, Dandy, and redeem
and enjoy the rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll think of it, Maister Longman. But ye hevn’t answered
my question. What brought yerself out? Not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>goold fever, I’ll be bound. I hev never seed ye handle a
pick or shool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not the gold fever. I was never fond of digging or
delving, or any sort of hard work. That was my ruin,
Dandy,” said Longman with a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ruin!” exclaimed old Andrew, looking at the speaker
from head to foot. “Well, then, ye are the foinest spacimin
of a well-presarved ruin as ever I seed in my loife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My hatred of steady work made me an outcast from my
home and an exile from my country, Dandy,” gravely replied
the hunter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A great, tall, strong fellow like you to be lazy!” exclaimed
Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not lazy; but averse to steady, hard, confining
work,” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ for that same did the feyther of ye turn ye adrift,
me poor Sam?” inquired Mike, striking into the talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not my father—he was dead; but my mother did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mither! Hivenly mither av us all!” exclaimed
Mike, stupidly staring at the hunter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I deserved it, Michael,” said the hunter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Och, thin, tell us all and about it, Sam, dear,” said
Mike sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Longman briefly told his little story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, my father was a small farmer at Chuxton, in
the North Riding of Yorkshire. I do not remember him,
though I hope some day to make his acquaintance in the
upper world. He left this one when I was a very young
child—the first and only child,” he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘The only son of his mother, and she a widow?’ Ye’ll be
looked after, Sam, be the Lord Himsilf, or ilse all the
howly fathers have taiched me is not true,” put in Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our neighbors used to say that my mother spoiled me.
I have often heard them say it to her before my face when
I was a bairn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, no doobt, they telled the truth,” exclaimed Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what would the mither say to that?” inquired
Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She would only draw me to her side and kiss me, to
comfort me for the mortification of hearing such words.
But you were right, Dandy. The neighbors did tell the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>truth. My poor, widowed young mother did spoil her only
child in her excessive fondness for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it was naterel,” admitted Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I grew up a very idle and headstrong boy, fonder of consorting
with gamekeepers, and even with poachers, than of
working on our farm. I think if I could have been taken
on as an assistant by some gamekeeper, who would have
given me plenty to do among guns and game, I might have
been contented to stay at home; but I could get no such
place. Besides, my work was badly wanted on the farm.
We were not able to hire laborers. My mother, myself and
one boy were expected to do everything; but I neglected my
part,” said Longman with a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one made any reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother bore with me very patiently for all the years I
was growing; but by the time I was twenty years old, and
as strong and tall for that age as if I had been twenty-five
instead, and when the farm had been growing from bad to
worse for years, my poor mother frequently lost her temper
and scolded me—scolded me, a man, whom she had never
scolded as a boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, faith, ye desarved it, hinny,” said Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know I did. But one thing I can remember with
satisfaction: bad as I was, I never gave my mother what
she would have called ‘the back answer.’ I never in my
life spoke an undutiful word to my mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for ye, Sam!” exclaimed Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When her words were very sharp and bitter, and I could
stand them no longer, I used to take my hat and walk out,
and never come back till night. And she—poor mother!—she
would have a nice, hot supper waiting for her prodigal
son, with some extra luxury that she could ill afford added
to the feast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ she was a good craychur, be that same token,” exclaimed
Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she was good—very good—but I tired her beyond
her patience. One day the crisis came; the rent was behindhand;
the bailiff was threatening; there seemed danger of
an eviction. Then my mother, in her grief and anger,
turned on me, said that if it had not been for my worthlessness
the farm would have been prosperous. She had said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that so often before that the words had lost all significance
to me. But she ended in saying this:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘If it hadn’t been for you, Samson, I shouldn’t ha’ been
brought to this disgrace and poverty. The cost of keeping
you in idleness would have paid an able-bodied farm laborer,
who would have kept the place in order. And now I tell
you, if you can’t work here, you had better go and find employment
somewhere else to suit you.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Faix, it was harrd on ye,” said Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was, though she did not mean it. She was half crazy
with the trouble that I might have warded off from her.
But, boys,” added Longman solemnly, “her words fell on
me stinging, burning, smarting, humiliating as a lash laid
on a naked back. Without a word I took up my hat and
walked out of the house, as I had often done before on other
but less bitter occasions; only this time I did not return.
That was five years ago. I have never seen my mother
since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A solemn silence fell on the trio.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently old Dandy inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ where did ye go thin? Ye couldn’t hev hed mooch
money in yer pocket, if there was none to pay the rint.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I had not a shilling. I walked into Chuxton, sold
my silver watch for all it would bring, and then took a
third-class ticket in the cheap parliamentary train to London,
shipped as an able-bodied seaman on board the <em>Auro</em>,
bound from St. Katherine’s Docks to the Golden Gate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So it was for goold ye kem, after all,” said Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. I never went near the mines in search of
gold. I drew my pay at ’Frisco, bought a couple of guns,
a lot of ammunition, some boots, and struck into the wilderness,
where there was plenty of game and no game laws.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ how hev ye thriven? Ye see, I niver knowed ye
afore we met in the woods last summer,” said Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have done well. I have been an industrious hunter.
I have supplied forts, post agencies, miners’ camps and
military caravans with game. I have saved more money
than you have, Dandy; and I am going home to old England—on
a visit, mind you, not to stay—I wouldn’t stay
there on any terms, unless some one would make me head
keeper on some estate where there is plenty of game. Even
that would be a poor substitute for the grand, free life of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the hunter in these wilds. But, Mike, why do you look at
me in that strange way?” Longman inquired of the Irish
boy, who had been sitting with his elbows on his knees, and
his head held between the palms of his hands, gazing silently
and steadfastly into the face of the hunter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis, I’m lookin’ at ye; I’m observin’ ye, Misther Longman.
That’s so! That’s a fact there’s no denyin’,” replied
Mike, without removing his gaze, which was becoming embarrassing,
if not offensive, to the good-natured hunter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why? What’s the matter?” demanded Longman,
shifting his position so as to get out of the range of Mike’s
eyes’ fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matther? Och! he ax what is the matther!
Haven’t ye just telled us how ye ran away fram yer poor
withowed mither in her throuble, an’ nivir wint back to ax
how she windded through it? An’ ye ax me what’s the matther?”
exclaimed Mike with much excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Mike, she turned me out of doors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, she didn’t, Misther Longman. Not aven on your
own showin’, which was like to be in your own favor. She
upbreeded you for idleness an’ neglect av dooty. An’ she
was right! An’ she told yer if ye couldn’t worruk on the
farrm ye’d betther go and worruk somewheres else. An’ she
was right again, so she was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, she was right; and I took her at her word and left
to work somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis; an’ ye were the vagabond av the worruld for doin’
that same, Misther Longman. Sure ye knew she nivir
meant it, an’ yez leaving must ha’ broke her heart, and yez
her onliest one in the worruld.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would you have had me to do, Mike?” inquired
Longman very patiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What wad I hev had ye to do, is it? Why, to hev gone
to worruk on the farm and mindded yer ways from that
hour, and hed the rint reddy on pay day. That’s what I
wud hev had ye to do, Misther Longman. I nivir hed a
mither; me and me twin swishter, Judy, was orphint childer—born
so—and nivir knowed a mither. But if I hed hed a
mither, and she had got mad at me and put me out av the
front door, I’d ’a’ kem in at the back one. I wud nivir hev
deserted me own mither—nivir! But I nivir hed a mither,
and thim as has blessings nivir vally thim. I’m spaking me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>mind, Misther Longman, and ye may dooble me oop and
fling me over the bank and brek me neck at the bottom of the
gulch if ye like, for ye’re twice as big and strong as meself,
but I’m bound to spake me mind!” exclaimed the Irish boy
excitedly, digging his hands in his trousers pockets and
straightening himself up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me your hand, Mike. You are a brave, true young
fellow, and all that you say is right. Now, then, I must tell
you that I have not neglected my mother. I wrote to her
before I sailed from London, telling her where I was going.
I also wrote to her from ’Frisco. I have written to her
from every available point where I have taken up my abode.
But I have never had an answer to any letter. She must
have discarded me, and perhaps married again, for she was
a comely woman, only thirty-eight years old, when I left
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did it nivir occur till ye that the letthers might be lost
in a wild, onsartin part uv the worruld like this?” inquired
Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I have thought of that. And lately—I don’t know
why—the thought has grown upon me that my poor mother
may be lonely and pining for her prodigal son. I cannot
get rid of that thought. It haunts me day and night. That
is why I have made up my mind to go home and make
friends with my mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if she ivir was anything else but frinds wi’ ye, Sam,
darlint!” broke in Mike. He had stopped calling his comrade
“Misther Longman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean that exactly. I meant to make it all up
with her, and to her, if I could. To give her all the money
I have saved, to make her comfortable for life; and then
come back to the free woods and the free game.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Less ye could win to a keeper’s place in the owld counthry,”
put in Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but that’s a dream,” laughed Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aven so, it’s a dhrame that may kem as thrue as me own
swishter Judy’s dhrame about her swateharrt that brought
her all through the Black Woods to find him at last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t in the least see how my dream—which was not
even a dream, but a passing thought of a bare possibility—can
come true,” laughed Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Then I’ll tell you!” exclaimed Mike. “Ye know Ran,
whose life ye saved?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, of course!” exclaimed Longman in surprise at the
vain question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I only wanted to mind ye of him. Ye know he
has kum into a great estate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, I have heard that, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, thin. He’s going to live on it. And if ye be
in England, and wanting av a keeper’s place, what more
natural than Misther Hay should pit you over his own kivvirs?
You thet saved his life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, of course, the estate has a gamekeeper already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tare an’ ’ounds, man, and supposin’ an’ if it has!
Misther Hay wud kape two keepers before he’d lave you
out’n the cold!” indignantly exclaimed Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know he would do all he possibly could for any of us.
But it is time enough to think of all that when we get to
England,” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And are you bent on going, Mr. Longman?” inquired
Andrew Quin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Bent on’ it, Dandy? I can’t help it. Something is
drawing me. I feel it all the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On a visit?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On a visit for the present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I go with you, sir, and come back with you, if I
feel like it—though it is giving up the chance of a grand
future.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is making reasonably sure of enjoying the rest of
your days, Dandy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, mates, if you’ll both be laving, it’s meself that will
go wid you. The ould fort will be right on our road, and
I can shtop there to see me swishter Judy, and then I’ll go
back to Grizzly. Grizzly ain’t no great shakes; but for a
steady-going old mining camp, that will nivir promise to
mek a man a millingnaire, nor yet starve him to death, but
sorter keep him a-going on fair hopes and fair profits, why,
thin, give me ould Grizzly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for you, Mike, my bold boy! We shall be glad to
have your company, even as far as the fort, if no further,”
said Longman, clapping his young comrade on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, boys,” said Andrew, “I hev hed twenty years’
experience in these regions, where both of you are, relatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>speaking, newcomers. And I tell you, airly as it is in the
season, there’s snow not far off, and if so be we are bound to
start, we had better be off to-morrow. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m riddy,” said Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you, Mr. Longman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I agree with you.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='large'>AT THE FORT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was a glorious November morning, not yet cold in the
latitude of the fort. Though there was a large wood fire in
the sitting-room of the colonel’s quarters, the front windows
were open, admitting the fresh air as well as the bright sunshine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel’s wife sat in her sewing-chair beside her
work-stand at some little distance from the open window
and nearer the fire, engaged in making a frock for one of
her younger girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy sat at the window with a book in her hand, dividing
her attention between the open page and the open view.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one else in the room. The colonel and his
eldest son, “Jim,” were at the adjutant’s office. All the
younger children were in the schoolroom under the charge
of their eldest sister, “Betty,” who was their teacher.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy had been three months separated from her brother,
and from her betrothed, and under the exclusive care of
Mrs. Moseley. Quick, witty, imitative and anxious to improve,
Judy had made rapid advances. She had recovered
all the half-forgotten book knowledge taught her at the convent
school, and had progressed considerably beyond that.
Hearing only good English spoken about her, she had
gradually dropped her sweet dialect, which both Col. Moseley
and Mr. Jim declared to be a lost charm, and only occasionally,
under emotion or excitement, she would suddenly
fall into it again. She was also better dressed than formerly;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>though again the colonel and his son declared not so
picturesquely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley had judiciously expended a portion of the
money left by Mike for the benefit of his sister, and her
short, red skirt and black jacket had given place to a brown
dress with white cuffs and collars, exchanged on Sundays
for a fine, dark blue one with embroidered frills.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mail came twice a week to the fort, and every mail
brought Judy two or more letters from Ran; for he wrote
nearly every day. The desire to answer all Ran’s letters was
a great spur to improvement in Judy, who, showing all her
compositions to Mrs. Moseley, begging her to correct the
spelling, grammar and punctuation, and then carefully
studying these corrections before making the clean copy that
finally went to her betrothed, made greater progress in
her education than she could have accomplished under any
other circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran kept her advised of everything that happened to him,
and his latest communications assured her that his cause
was going on swimmingly, though, of course, there were,
necessarily, “law’s delays.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To corroborate this, Mrs. Moseley received occasional letters
from her old schoolmate, Mrs. Samuel Walling, who
gave her chapter after chapter of what she called this romance
in real life; how much the hero of it was admired
by all to whom she had introduced him; how from his dark
beauty and grace he was dubbed the Oriental Prince; how
he was taken up by every one in society except the Vansitarts,
who, in the interests of their late governess and
favorite, and with idiotic obstinacy, disallowed a claim that
every one else was forced to admit; last of all, how young
Randolph Hay had discovered a lovely cousin, and sole surviving
relative, in Palma Hay Stuart, the only child of his
late Uncle James Jordan Hay, and the wife of Cleve Stuart,
a man of fortune from Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c009'>Much of this information—all of it, in fact, except that
which concerned his “lionizing”—Ran had faithfully imparted
to Judy. And she rejoiced in his present prosperity
and future prospects.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy had but one source of anxiety—her Brother Mike!
Three letters she had received from him since he took leave
of her in September; but these had reached her at intervals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of a week or ten days apart, and since the last of these
three, two months had passed and she had heard nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were times when she grew very much distressed,
and felt almost sure that the party of adventurers to which
Mike belonged had been massacred.</p>

<p class='c009'>On this splendid November morning Judy, sitting at the
window, with her grammar in hand, was more than usually
downcast.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, there was the news that had come to her from her
betrothed, that he was to sail for England about the first of
December with Mr. Will Walling, to go through certain
forms, preliminary to taking possession of the Hay estate
and ousting the present usurper; his absence must be indefinite;
but he would return as soon as possible—he hoped
in two months’ time at the furthest. That news depressed
the girl very much; but that was not all. The mail that
brought Ran’s letter brought none from Mike. It was at
least her twentieth disappointment, but she felt it as bitterly
as if it had been her first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter, Judy?” at length inquired the colonel’s
wife, noticing the dejected countenance of her
protégée.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma’am, it’s about Mike! I am sure the Indians
must have—— Oh, ma’am, I can’t spake it!” the girl answered,
breaking off with a sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor child, there is really no cause for such keen
anxiety. Your brother and his party have gone far beyond
the mail route in their search for silver. He cannot send
a letter to you from his present camp, except by the chance
of some one returning toward the mail routes. Be patient
and hopeful, Judy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do try, ma’am; but it is awful to lose one’s brother in
such a—void!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no void in which any creature can be lost,
Judy; for the Creator is everywhere, and He is our Father
as well, and none of His children can stray out of His presence.
It must be dreadful to have any beloved one disappear
mysteriously, but it is certain that the Lord knows
where he or she is, and will take care of His child, living
or dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe that, ma’am,” said Judy, trying to rally her
spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>She returned to the study of her book; but her thoughts
were too distracted for concentration, and her eyes wandered
from the page to the open window. The great gates of the
fort were directly in front of the colonel’s quarters and
about a hundred yards distant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Judy, looking out toward them, dropped her
book, started up and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why! What!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she stopped and gazed through the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, my child?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A strange officer, ma’am, and several strange soldiers
coming in at the gate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley laid down her work and came and joined
Judy at the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>A small troop of horsemen, about ten men in all, with
an officer at their head, marched through the gate, wheeled
to the right, and rode up to the adjutant’s quarters, where
they all dismounted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The officer, attended by an orderly, went into the office.</p>

<p class='c009'>The men remained outside, standing by their horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does it mean, ma’am, do you think?” inquired
Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. It may be some small reinforcement on
their way to some other fort. We shall hear when the
colonel comes in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the lady spoke the orderly came out of the adjutant’s
office and spoke to the dismounted men, who immediately
dispersed, leading their horses away.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two women stood a few minutes longer at the window,
and then, as there was nothing more to be learned by
looking out, each returned to her employment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even after that, Judy continued to glance from her lesson
in syntax, through the open window that commanded the
great gates and a broad sweep of the fort grounds; but
nothing occurred to reward her vigilance or satisfy her
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length she grew tired of watching, and gave her undivided
attention to her lesson.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two hours passed, and the colonel might have been seen
coming from the adjutant’s office to his own quarters, with
a brisk step and a radiant face, with full twenty years taken
off his fifty.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Good news, Dolly, my dear!” he said, bursting into the
sitting-room. “Good news! Dispatches from Washington.
Call all the children together to hear the good news.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go, Judy, dear, and bring them,” exclaimed Mrs. Moseley
in eager anticipation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy flew to do her bidding, and soon the room was filled
with the progeny of the military patriarch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s Jim?” demanded the colonel, looking around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here I am, father,” said the eldest son, entering the
room at that moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Betty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, father, behind you. So close to you that you can’t
see me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Baby Lu?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right there between your feet, father. If you look down
you will see her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadn’t you better call the roll, dad? Then you will be
sure that we are all here!” cried Master Clin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold your tongue, you young scamp, and listen!” exclaimed
the colonel, laughing. Then turning to his wife
gravely, almost tearfully, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dolly, my dear, it has come at last! It has been a long
time coming. I have got my promotion and six months’
leave!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley jumped from her chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Moses! Moses! I am so glad! So thankful! I
never expected it in our lifetime—never! I looked that we
should live and die among the frontier forts, with no change
but from one to another. Oh, thank Heaven! Thank
Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maj. Lawson will succeed me in command here. Capt.
King, who brought the dispatches, remains here with the
ten new recruits who are to take the places of as many of
our soldiers whose terms of service are drawing to a close.
There, children, there is my good news. Now be off with
you and rollic over it!” he added, turning to the young
people.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! father dear, are we really going East? Really
going to the cities and to civilization?” breathlessly demanded
Betty, thinking this news much too good, too wonderful
to be true.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>And the faces of all the other children eagerly seconded
their elder sister’s question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really and truly, my dear ones. And my pleasure in
going is immeasurably heightened by the joy the anticipation
of the change gives you all. Now run away; I wish to
speak to your mother,” he said, smiling on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell us one thing, dad, do!” said Master Clinton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what is it, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When are we going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a very few days. I cannot tell you yet what day.
Now run away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy scampered off, and his army of brothers and
sisters followed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy also would have left the room, but Mrs. Moseley
stopped her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stay, my dear girl. We only sent the children away that
they might give vent to their joy in the open air, as you hear
them doing. Now, Moses!” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear, it is only this: King will dine with us
to-day, and I have invited Lawson, and Hill, and Perry to
meet him. Is it too late to make some suitable addition to
our family spread?” anxiously inquired the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! no, not if we put back the dinner an hour. There
is a fine haunch of venison, a buffalo tongue, and a bunch
of prairie fowl that I have just bought from an Indian.
And then I will open my preserve jars in honor of the occasion,
though I did not intend to touch them until Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are a tower of strength, Dolly, my dear, but we
shall not be here at Christmas. Now I have something to
do over at the office. I will be back with King a little
while before dinner,” concluded the colonel as he left the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter, Judy? You look very grave, my
dear,” said Mrs. Moseley, who was at last at leisure to observe
her protégée.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma’am!” said the girl in a broken voice, being almost
in tears; “oh, dear, ma’am, it is not that I am not glad
and thankful for the good fortune that has come to you and
the dear colonel and the childer——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Children, Judy.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Yes, ma’am, children, to be sure, only sometimes I do
forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you were saying——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, I was saying I am glad and thankful to
the Lord and all the saints for the blessing and the prosperity
that have come to you; but, but, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what, Judy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl did not answer, but burst into tears and sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judy! Judy! Judy! What is all this? Are you crying
because you are doubtful of what is to become of you?”
tenderly inquired the lady, laying her hand on the girl’s
curly, dark hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the parting with yeez a’, ma’am! And the thought
what will I do at all, at all, when ye lave this! Oh, sure
it is a silfish wretch that I am to be graiving for meself,
instid of rejoicing with yeez!” wept the girl, backsliding
hopelessly into her dialect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judy, dear, do you think we would leave you behind?
No, dear, not one of us would think of such a cruel thing.
We must take you with us, Judy, my poor child!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma’am, sure and it’s a hivinly angel av goodness ye
are and always was, and meself always said it. And I’d go
with you, willing, and glad, and grateful, only there’s me
poor Mike. If Mike should write to me, or come to see
me, what wud he do not to find me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My girl, we would leave word with the adjutant to forward
any letters that might come for you, and if your
brother should appear in person, to tell him where you were
to be found. There! will that do? And remember we are
going to New York, and you will see Ran before he sails
for England. Come, now! will that do?” archly inquired
the colonel’s wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yis, ma’am! Yis, sure!” exclaimed Judy, her eyes
sparkling through her tears. “And sure meself will be
the thankful craychur!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Creature, Judy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So it is! Creature, ma’am, thank you, and I will learn
after a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley then left the sitting-room and went to the
kitchen to give directions to the soldier’s wife who filled the
place of her cook.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Judy laid aside her book and began to put the room in
order for the visitors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Punctually at about fifteen minutes before the dinner
hour the colonel came in with Capt. King, a fine, tall, stalwart-looking
man with dark complexion, black hair and
mustache, and about thirty-five years of age. He introduced
the strangers to Mrs. Moseley, who received him
cordially, and to “Miss Man,” who only bowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were soon joined by the major, the adjutant and
the surgeon, and then all went in to dinner. Judy scarcely
opened her lips in speech during the meal, for fear of falling
into her dialect. The impromptu dinner party passed
off very successfully, and the evening passed gayly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day being Tuesday, preparations for leaving
the fort were commenced by the colonel and his family.</p>

<p class='c009'>They fixed the ensuing Monday for their departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley, in the midst of her packing, found time
to write to her friend, Augusta Walling, announcing their
return to the East, and asking her to find a large furnished
house suitable to their large family and moderate income,
somewhere in an inexpensive suburb of New York, and to
have it ready for them to enter on their arrival, to save the
cost of going to a hotel with their numerous party.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every one was happy except Judy, who was grieving to
go away without having heard from her missing brother,
even though she was going where she would be sure to meet
her betrothed.</p>

<p class='c009'>With distressful anxiety she watched for the one remaining
mail that would come in before they would leave the
fort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thursday, the next mail day, came and brought her letters
from Ran, telling her of the progress of his business
and the passing of his time, and that he had at length
secured apartments in the same building with his cousins,
and had left his hotel to establish himself there until he
should sail for England.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy was satisfied so far as her lover was concerned; but
she was so bitterly disappointed and distressed at not getting
any news of her brother by this last mail that she felt
as if her last hope for him had died out, almost as if she
might mourn him as dead, and she went away to her own
tiny room to have her cry out by herself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Then she wrote a long letter addressed to her brother, in
which she explained to him the necessity of leaving the
fort with the colonel’s family, and begging him to write to
her or come and see her.</p>

<p class='c009'>This she placed in the adjutant’s hands, begging him to
give it to Mike if he should come to the fort.</p>

<p class='c009'>By Friday night all the preparations for departure were
completed. It had been a heavy week’s work to get ready a
family of fifteen for a removal and a long journey, but the
task was finished at last, and the colonel said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may now take two Sabbaths’ rest, the Jewish and
the Christian, before setting out on our pilgrimage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And that night the whole family went to bed tired enough
to enjoy the two days’ rest to come.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day—Saturday—was a beautiful day, clear,
and bright, and mild. Fine fires were burning in all the
fireplaces, but all the windows were open.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley was distributing to the few soldiers’ wives
that were in the camp many household articles that she
would not want. Also she was receiving informal visits
from officers’ wives, who were sorry to have her leave the
fort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy, having nothing on earth to do, was walking up
and down on the piazza of the colonel’s quarters, thinking
of her brother, Mike, and his too probable fate.</p>

<p class='c009'>On this day, people were coming in and going out of
the fort gates continually; but Judy took no notice of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently there came through the gates another troop—not
a troop of horse as on the preceding Monday, but a
very small troop on foot, consisting of some half a dozen
of the most ragged, dirty, forlorn and Heaven-forsaken
looking tramps that Christian eyes ever beheld.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy, pacing up and down the piazza, never saw them.
She was muttering to herself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know he is dead, but I shall never know how he died,
or where he died, or how much he might have suffered
before he died. And this will be a sorrow to me worse than
death itself! A life-long sorrow that even me darlint Ran
can nivir comfort me for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A familiar voice called in her ear, a hard hand clapped
her on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>She sprang as if she had been shot, gazed for an instant
as if she had gone mad, and then, with a great cry, flung
herself in her brother’s arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike was worn out with his wearisome tramp, so he sat
down on one of the wooden benches, drew his sister on
his knees, and held her to his bosom, where she lay sobbing
in a great paroxysm of emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her cry had brought Mrs. Moseley and several other
members of the family to the door. They saw Mike sitting
there with his sister’s face hidden on his bosom. Mike
lifted his old rag of a hat to the lady, who smiled and returned
into the house with all who had followed her to the
door. She would not disturb such a joyful meeting. She
was as much delighted as surprised that it had come so
opportunely.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was some time before Judy was composed enough to
speak. And even then her first utterances were incoherent
ejaculations of thankfulness, delight and affection. At
length she said, falling into her old dialect:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s an answer to prayer! It’s a blissing come down
from the Mither av Hivin. Oh, sure me harrt was breaking
in me brest to lave this, an’ yoursilf away, and me unbeknownst
of whativir hed become av ye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wheriver were ye going, Judy?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, sure ye didn’t know! How should ye?” she said.
And then she told him the situation, and inquired, in her
turn, how it was that he came so happily to see her, before
her departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That Silver Moon Mine was jist the most misfortunate
ventur’ as ivir was made! Iviry one of the bhoys as went
from Grizzly have come back, hed to, ilse we wud ha’ perished
in the snow there, this winter. What a differint climit
this is! Why, it’s almost like simmir here compared to
there. So we’s all going back to slow and sure old Grizzly.
All, lasteways, ixcipt Longman and Dandy, who are going
back to the ould counthry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mike, are you going back to Grizzly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis, sure! Where ilse wud I go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mike, don’t let us be parted! Go with me to New
York! Ran is going to England about the first of December;
wouldn’t you like to see him once more before he
goes?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Mike hesitated, then he said slowly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, and I wud like to go with ye, Judy, and I wud
like to see Ran, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t say but, Mike. Draw out the bit of money ye
left in the savings bank at ’Frisco, and come with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis, but what the divil will I do before I get to ’Frisco
without a cint av money or a dacint suit av clothes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—I’ll—I’ll—I’ll spake to the colonel’s leddy!” said
Judy, springing up impulsively and running into the house
to lay the case before her benefactress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley was all sympathy and kindness, and soon
devised a plan by which Mike should have an outfit and
transportation to San Francisco, where he might draw his
savings from the bank, and repay all advances.</p>

<p class='c009'>That day and the next, through the kindness of the colonel
and his officers, the footsore, starved and wearied
tramps were fed and rested at the fort.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday the determined miners went on their way to
Grizzly, well provided with food and drink for their journey
through the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time a train of ambulances and army
wagons, containing the colonel and his numerous family,
the discharged soldiers, with Longman, Mike, Dandy and
much goods, filed out of the fort gates and took the road to
St. Agnetta, where they were all to take the train to San
Francisco, en route for New York.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='large'>A GLAD SURPRISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I have found them, ma’am! I have found them! And
they are charming—charming!” exclaimed Ran Hay with
boyish exultation, bursting into Mrs. Samuel Walling’s parlor
with the freedom of an inmate on the morning succeeding
his meeting with Cleve and Palma Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down, you excitable fellow, and tell me whom you
have found. Is it Sir John Franklin and his crew, or is it
Mr. Livingstone?” inquired the lady, rising and giving her
hand to the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Neither, ma’am; though I would give my life to find
either if it were possible. But I have found my own dear
cousins!” replied Ran, dropping into a chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your Uncle James Jordan’s children? Those whom you
advertised for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His daughter, ma’am; his sole surviving child, Palma,
and her husband, Cleve Stuart, who is the only son and sole
heir of the late John Stuart, a rich planter of Mississippi.
They are a charming young couple, only a few months married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cleve Stuart?” said Mrs. Walling, musing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I know him! He used to be a devoted admirer of
Lamia Leegh. We all thought that it would certainly be
a match. But I fancy she discarded him in favor of the
wealthier suitor, your treacherous traveling companion,
Gentleman Geff, the rival claimant of Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If she did she made a miserable mistake. But I do not
think she did. I don’t believe she ever had the chance. I
cannot fancy Stuart ever having been enslaved by any
woman before his lovely wife, to whom he is perfectly devoted!”
replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! well, I may have been mistaken. He was very
much in society. So was Miss Leegh. They were frequently
together. But tell me how you found them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Through that advertisement, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I know. But how?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Stuart answered my advertisement by coming in
person to my hotel; finding me out, he left a note with his
address, asking me to call there. I got that note when I
came in, and immediately started out to see my cousins. I
found them in an elegant little flat, their rooms almost as
charming as themselves. I spent the afternoon with them,
dined with them, went to the theater with them, supped
with them, and only left them in the ‘wee sma’ hours’ of
the morning. And I could not sleep for happiness in the
thought of having found my kindred, and such delightful
kindred! Then as soon as possible this morning I came to
tell you the good news.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad to hear it, Mr. Hay! I have lost sight
of Mr. Stuart for the last six months.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is just as long as they have been married. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>were married on the first of May last, and spent the whole
season at some place up the Hudson, and have only been in
town for a few weeks. And I do not think she knows a
soul here!” said Ran with a pleading look in his soft, dark
eyes that said as plainly as words could have spoken:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you please to take the dear little one under your
wing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling replied just as if he had spoken his plea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, certainly, I will call on Mrs. Stuart with great
pleasure if you will give me her address.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When? Oh, when?” demanded Ran with more eagerness
than politeness. And then suddenly remembering
himself he said: “Oh, I beg pardon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, any time—this week, to-morrow, to-day, if you
like. Yes, to-day, it will be just as convenient as any other
day. Will you escort me, Mr. Hay?” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, with the greatest pleasure and gratitude, ma’am.
You are very kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling touched a bell, which brought a servant to
the room. She ordered her carriage to be brought to
the door, and then turning to young Hay, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you will remain here until I put on my bonnet and
wraps I will not keep you long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran rose and bowed, and Mrs. Walling left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twenty minutes later Ran handed the lady into her carriage,
entered after her, and gave the order:</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the Alto Flats.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The truth is that Mrs. Samuel Walling was impelled by
curiosity as well as by neighborly kindness in thus promptly
going to call on Mrs. Cleve Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>A half hour’s drive brought them to the flats.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving Mrs. Walling in the carriage, but taking her
card, he entered the office of the house and gave it, with his
own, to the janitor’s boy, who took them upstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>In five minutes the boy came down and reported that
Mrs. Cleve Stuart was at home, and would the gentleman
and lady come up?</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran returned to the carriage, assisted Mrs. Walling to
alight, and conducted her into the house; they entered the
elevator and were soon “landed” at the door of the private
hall leading into the Stuarts’ suite of apartments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy opened the parlor door and they entered.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Palma, neatly dressed in her well-worn, best suit of crimson
cashmere, with its narrow, white frills at throat and
wrists, and her curly, black hair lightly shading her forehead,
arose from her chair and came forward with shy grace
to receive her visitors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Mrs. Samuel Walling, dear Cousin Palma. She
does me the honor to be my good friend. Mrs. Walling, my
cousin, Mrs. Cleve Stuart,” said Ran, going through the introduction
as well as he could.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma put out her hand shyly, half in doubt whether she
should do so or not, and murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very happy to see you, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mrs. Walling took her hand with a frank and cordial
smile and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am delighted to know you! I should have recognized
you without an introduction, anywhere, from your likeness
to your cousin here! Why, you might be twins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few minutes the three friends were seated and talking
as freely as if they had known each other all their lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Evidently the two women were mutually pleased with
each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>While they conversed Cleve Stuart came in from his
daily, fruitless quest after employment.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked surprised and pleased to see Mrs. Walling with
his wife, and warmly shook hands with her, expressing his
satisfaction at meeting her again after so long an interval
of time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was your own fault, Mr. Stuart. You should have
sent an old friend your wedding cards,” said the lady,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We had none, madam. My little girl was an invalid,
and our wedding was a very quiet one at Lull’s, where I had
taken her for a change of air,” replied Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will not excuse you, sir. On your return to the city
with your sweet, young wife, you should have sent me your
address, that I might have called sooner. I hold that you
have deprived me of some weeks’ enjoyment I should otherwise
have had in the acquaintance of Mrs. Cleve Stuart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I have no more to say, dear madam, but to throw
myself upon your mercy,” replied Stuart as he seated himself
near the group.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, my dear,” said Mrs. Walling, turning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Palma, “we must make up for lost time by becoming at
once very intimate friends. Now, will you come and take
tea with me to-morrow at six o’clock? Not a fashionable
tea, dear child, at which hundreds of people sip Oolong or
Gunpowder out of dolls’ china cups, but a real unfashionable
tea party of ten or a dozen intimate friends, who assemble
at ‘early candle-light,’ and sit comfortably down to
a long table—a custom of my grandmother’s that I loved
in my childhood, and brought with me from old Maryland
to this city, and indulge in whenever I can with some of my
friends. Will you come, you and Mr. Stuart, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With much pleasure, thank you, ma’am,” replied Palma,
speaking for both.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you to meet my friend, Mrs. Duncan, and one
or two other good people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you very much, madam,” said Palma shyly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will be glad to make friends among your friends,
Mrs. Walling, for she is almost a stranger here,” added
Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then, to-morrow afternoon, at six o’clock,”
concluded the lady, and she arose to take her leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran shook hands with his cousins and escorted Mrs. Walling
back to her carriage, and would have bid her good-by
at the door, but that the lady said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in here, Mr. Hay. I want to have more talk
with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they were seated and were well on their way along
the avenue Mrs. Walling said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have heard from our friends at the fort but once since
your arrival, Mr. Hay! The letter of introduction you
brought is the last, except a card, I have had from Mrs.
Moseley, and never has so long an interval passed without
hearing from her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you answered her last letter, dear madam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I did, immediately, and have written one or
two since. Have you heard from them, Mr. Hay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not for two weeks! And I should be very anxious if I
did not know that they must have written. The mails in
that unsettled region are very irregular, often delayed and
sometimes lost. That condition of affairs out there explains
an apparent silence that might otherwise make me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>seriously anxious. We shall get letters by and by, Mrs.
Walling, for every mail is not lost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I hope they got my letters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They must have received every one, though we have got
none,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the carriage drew up before the Walling house and
Ran had helped the lady to alight and escorted her to her
own door, he would have taken leave, but she insisted that
he should enter with her and remain for dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>There he spent the evening, after dinner taking a hand
in a rubber of whist with Mrs. Walling and the two Messrs.
Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>That same night Mr. Samuel Walling left by the late
train for Washington to see the British minister. He expected
to be back in three days.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Mrs. Walling sent out her few invitations
to intimate friends for her entertainment. It was
only under certain conditions that the lady could indulge
in the practical reminiscence of her childhood, represented
by this old-fashioned tea party, which, when it occurred,
always superseded the late dinner; and the first of these
conditions was the absence of her husband, who could never
give up a dinner for a tea, no matter how abundantly the
table for the latter might be spread.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Walling’s journey to Washington furnished her opportunity
on this occasion. So, early in the morning, she
sent out about half a dozen little cocked-hat notes of invitation
to some of her old friends not among the most
fashionable of her acquaintances. And all who were disengaged
accepted at once. Among these was good little Mrs.
Duncan, and old Mrs. Murphy, and Miss Christiansen—all
pleasant people.</p>

<p class='c009'>At six o’clock her guests began to arrive—only eight in
number, including the hostess. Six of these were ladies,
the only gentlemen present being Mr. Cleve Stuart, Mr.
Randolph Hay and Mr. Roger Duncan.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elegant and luxurious “tea” was as abundant and
varied as any dinner need be, and much more dainty than
any dinner can be. It was not a full dress party, nor a
ceremonious occasion; so both before and after tea there
was some card playing and much gossip.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Stuart and Mr. Duncan, with Miss Christiansen and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Mrs. Murphy, sat down to a rubber of whist. Mrs. Walling,
Mrs. Duncan, Mrs. Stuart and Mr. Hay sat near each other
in a group and gossiped with all their might and main.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Duncan was the principal talker; and after telling
many a spicy but harmless bit of news, she took up the story
of her protégée, Jennie Montgomery, and soon interested all
her hearers in it. The facts were new to them all except
to herself and Mrs. Murphy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What puzzled me about the young thing was this: That
while she had lost every particle of respect and affection for
her would-be murderer, she persisted in shielding him from
justice. Now, I can understand a woman shielding a criminal
whom she has loved, and still loves; but I cannot
understand her protecting an assassin who has aimed at
her life, and whom she fears and abhors!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Palma’s eyes began to sparkle. She had her little
story to tell, too. And she wanted to tell it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know,” she said, as soon as she could slip into
the busy conversation—“do you know that my husband was
arrested by mistake for Capt. Kightly Montgomery, and
held for a murderous assault, until he could prove his identity
by competent witnesses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The ladies, startled by this information, made little, low
exclamations of surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your husband was one of the witnesses, Mrs. Walling,”
continued Palma, pleased with herself that she could contribute
some little item of interest to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! I think I remember hearing something about
some one being arrested by mistake, charged with something
or other, and Mr. Walling being called as a witness to prove
the accused to be some other than the man wanted; but,
really, now, there are so many sensational items in the daily
papers that one shoves the other from the memory. So it
was Mr. Cleve Stuart, was it? Pleasant for him,” said
Mrs. Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it was really your husband, Mrs. Stuart, who was
taken to the woman’s ward of the hospital to be identified
by Jennie Montgomery! I heard all about it at the time,
but I had forgotten the name of the gentleman who had
been arrested by mistake,” said Mrs. Duncan, taking a good
look at Stuart, who was in a fine light for the view, seated
at the card table immediately under a chandelier. “And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>there certainly is a very striking likeness between him and
the miniature of the young woman’s murderous husband,”
she concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then all the other ladies turned and gazed at Stuart,
who was blissfully unconscious of the severe scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But though there is a striking likeness, there is also a
very great difference,” resumed Mrs. Duncan. “But you
can see for yourselves. By the merest chance I have that
miniature in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do let us see it, dear Mrs. Duncan, do!” pleaded
Palma, eager to behold the likeness that had led to her
husband’s false arrest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my dear; but first let me tell you how I happen to
have it in my possession, and also to have it with me here.
Mrs. Montgomery spent the last ten days of her stay in the
city in my house. The miniature which had been found in
her possession when the police searched her room, and had
been used in the vain effort to trace her assailant, was at
length restored to her. And to show how entirely she had
ceased to care for the man who tried to murder her, she
actually forgot his picture, and left it behind in her bureau
drawer. I never chanced to find it until this morning; and
as I was coming out, I thought I would do it up and send it
out to her by mail. So I put it in a small box, directed and
sealed it and put it in my pocket with the intention of
posting it, and then—forgot all about it until now. Now
you shall see it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She drew a small pasteboard box from her pocket, broke
the seals, opened it and took out a small morocco case, which
she also opened and handed to Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a slight resemblance. Only a very slight one.
I do not see how any one could mistake this sinister-looking
face for a miniature of Mr. Stuart. Now, do you, Mrs.
Walling?” said Palma with an aggrieved air as she passed
the picture to her friend and hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a very wonderful likeness to my eyes, my dear,
in features, hair, complexion and all—except expression.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And expression is everything. I see scarcely any likeness
myself,” persisted Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you allow me to look at it?” Ran inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling placed it in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Now, do you see any likeness between that ill face and
Cleve’s?” inquired Palma, appealing to her cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not the least!” exclaimed Ran on the first cursory
glance at the miniature. Then holding it closer and gazing
more attentively he exclaimed suddenly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I know this fellow! It is Gentleman Geff, as he
appeared when he first came to Grizzly, before he shaved his
mustache off and let his beard grow! It’s Gentleman Geff!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Gentleman Geff!’” echoed all the ladies, except Mrs.
Walling, who took the picture and gazed at it in silence for
a moment, and then, returning it, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! I see now! So it is! Though the full beard
made so great a difference that even the likeness did not
occur to me. Excuse me one moment, friends. I will return
directly.” And she hastily left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran could scarcely get over his astonishment at his discovery.
Gentleman Geff, the very fine dude who had seemed
too dainty for any of the rudenesses of life, yet who had
treacherously shot him in the woods, robbed him of his
documents, and possessed himself of his estates, was also
the man who had attempted the murder of his own wife and
feloniously married another woman!</p>

<p class='c009'>“But who is Gentleman Geff?” inquired Palma, Mrs.
Duncan and Miss Christiansen, in a breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please wait a little, ladies, until the return of Mrs.
Walling. Perhaps she will inform you, or allow me to tell
you, who he is,” said Ran respectfully, and even deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling returned with what might be called Mr.
Walling’s professional photograph album in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>She opened it at a certain page and pointed out a face
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at that and compare it with the miniature, and
then tell me if the two are not likenesses of the same person,
notwithstanding the difference made by the mustache on
one face and the full beard on the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had handed the two pictures first to Palma, who
gazed for a moment, and then nodded assent, and passed
them around to her companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But who is the man?” inquired Mrs. Duncan, while
Palma and Miss Christiansen seconded the question by their
eager looks.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Friends, he was one of Messrs. Wallings’ clients, but is
so no longer. He has managed to deceive two astute lawyers,
to impose upon society, to get hold of a name and an
estate that does not belong to him, and to marry the most
beautiful woman in the country and take her off to Europe
in triumph, while his own deserted wife and child, whom
he believed he had safely disposed of by murder, sailed with
him in the same ship, unsuspected by him, unsuspicious,
also, it seems, of her faithless, murderous husband’s presence
there. He is an adventurer of many aliases, a gambler,
a forger, a swindler, a perjurer, a bigamist and an assassin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling paused a moment to look upon her shocked
audience, and then continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is the man. What his name is I cannot tell you.
We knew him as Mr. Randolph Hay, of Haymore. You
have all heard of him under that name, and the <i><span lang="fr">éclat</span></i> of the
splendid festivities at the Vansitart mansion on the occasion
of his marriage with Miss Leegh has scarcely died away.
Jennie Montgomery knew him as Capt. Kightly Montgomery;
my young friend, Mr. Hay, knew him as Geoffrey
Delamere, Esq.; and gamblers of Grizzly Gulch as Gentleman
Geff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She paused again to mark the effect of her words.</p>

<p class='c009'>But no one spoke; the women were shocked into silence
and pallor. At length, however, Ran murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is too horrible!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know that the man whom society has been lionizing
for the last six months is a fraudulent claimant of the Haymore
estate; you should also know that this gentleman here,
whom I introduced to you as simply Mr. Hay, is really the
true Randolph Hay, of Haymore, and a few weeks at
furthest will see him invested with his manor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Duncan and Miss Christiansen both turned to congratulate
Ran, who laughed and blushed like a girl at the
honor due him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Four by honors and six by tricks, and we have beat the
rubber!” exclaimed Mr. Roger Duncan, rising in triumph
from the whist table and breaking in upon the gravity of
the circle collected around the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one of that circle thought of speaking to the others
of their discovery through the miniature and photograph.</p>

<p class='c009'>And soon the company broke up.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='large'>UNEXPECTED ARRIVALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>From this day forth the life of Cleve and Palma
changed. They made friends and went much into company
through the introductions of Mrs. Walling. They were
young and innocently fond of gayety, and they were led on
by Ran, who was liberally supplied with money advanced
by his solicitors, and who, from being a daily visitor at
their apartments, had at last taken up his abode under the
same roof for the sake of being nearer to them until he
should sail for England, accompanied by Mr. William Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unfortunately, neither Randolph Hay nor the Wallings
suspected the impoverished condition of their new friends,
else they would not have tempted or led the young pair
into a way of life so much above their means.</p>

<p class='c009'>As it was, their scanty little fund had to be drawn upon
for such additions to Palma’s toilet, and even to Cleve’s, in
the way of nice boots and fresh gloves, that seemed really
indispensable to them when they went out in the evening.
Had Palma even suspected their own poverty she would not
have gone anywhere if it cost money to go there. But,
unsuspicious as she was, believing, as she did, that her husband
was in very easy circumstances, she went out a great
deal; and Cleve, seeing how much she enjoyed society, had
not the heart to check her enjoyment by telling her the
truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only gloves and boots and car fare her pleasures cost
them. She had two dresses, the crimson cashmere, much
worn, but carefully preserved, and often cleaned and repaired
for continual use by the careful hands of Mrs. Pole.
This was her dress for dinners and afternoon teas. Her
white India muslin—her confirmation robe, and afterward
her wedding suit—was now her only evening dress. Neither
of these were at all stylish, but they were neat and clean;
and then her boots and gloves were perfectly fitting, fresh
and faultless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every day Cleve went forth to seek employment, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>every night returned disappointed to find himself poorer by
the day’s expenditures than he had been the day before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything was going out and nothing coming in; and
yet he shrank from saying to Palma:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We cannot afford another pair of new gloves even,
dear,” or to do anything but smile in her face when she
would only ask him to go with her to a lunch party at Mrs.
Duncan’s, or to a five-o’clock tea at Miss Christiansen’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>If Ran had only known their straits as he bounded daily
up and down the stairs, too full of life and energy to avail
himself of the elevator, how gladly, how joyously, would he
have poured into his cousin’s lap wealth from his own abundant
means, nor ever dreamed of offering offense in proffering
what he himself, in their reversed circumstances,
would have been frankly willing to receive from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he knew nothing, suspected nothing, of their poverty;
and even if he had known, and had offered to give
assistance, Cleve Stuart, in his spirit of pride or independence,
would have refused it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran held firmly to his purpose of giving his cousin a fair
share of their grandfather’s estate, as soon as he himself
should be put in lawful possession, which was only a question
of a few weeks’ time; but he said nothing more about
it to either Palma or Cleve. He thought they understood
his intentions, and believed in them, and that it would be
in bad taste to refer to them again. Besides, he did not
suspect how dark the future looked to one of them at least,
and what a source of anxiety it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>What the young pair really thought of their cousin’s offer
to share, was just this—that it had been made, not from a
delicate sense of justice that would stand the test of time
and opportunity, but from a sudden impulse of generosity
that might yield to cool afterthought. Neither of them
placed much reliance on the offer, especially as they had
repudiated it at the time, and Ran had never renewed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day for young Hay’s departure for England was at
length fixed. He was to sail on the second of December.
It had been first suggested that Mr. Samuel Walling should
attend him to England, and introduce him personally to the
London solicitors of the Hays of Haymore; but, as usual,
Mr. Will put in his plea of overwork, brain exhaustion,
want of change, and so on, and, as usual, his claim was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>allowed, and it was decided that he should accompany the
young heir.</p>

<p class='c009'>The aged priest, Father Pedro de Leon, having under
oath testified to the identity of Randolph Hay, had bidden
an affectionate good-by to his pupil and returned to his
flock in San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was remarkable that while Mr. Sam Walling, the head
of the firm of Walling &#38; Walling, took all the heaviest responsibilities,
did all the hardest work, seldom left his desk
during the office hours, and never left the city except on
business, Mr. Will, the junior partner, required all the
relaxation in frequent visits to Newport and Saratoga during
the summer months, and Washington and even Savannah
during the winter season. And now it seemed absolutely
necessary that Mr. Will should have a sea voyage to restore
the shaken equilibrium of his overtasked mind and body.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just it!” Mrs. Walling said one day to Ran when
speaking of the trip to England. “Our firm, as a firm, is
always full of work, yet manages to have a good deal of
play also; only Sam takes the work and Will the play.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the month of November drew to a close and the day
of his departure came near, Ran grew more and more uneasy.
He had not heard a word from Judy for more than
three weeks, though in that time he had written so many
letters; nor had Mrs. Walling lately heard from Mrs. Moseley.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran was not of a temperament to borrow trouble. Quite
the contrary; he always looked on the bright side. He was
willing to make every allowance for the well-known uncertainty
of the mails in those unsettled regions guarded by
the frontier forts; but still it seemed strange and alarming
that for a month past no mail had come safely through
contingent dangers.</p>

<p class='c009'>His greatest anxiety now was that he should have to sail
for Europe without having heard from Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>He confided his trouble to Cleve and Palma, with whom
he now spent every evening whenever they were at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>One evening, about a week before he was to sail, he was
sitting with Cleve and Palma in their tiny parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve had been reading aloud, but laid down his book on
the entrance of Ran. Palma was knitting a woolen wristlet,
the last of four pair that she had been making for Cleve and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Mrs. Pole, and she continued to knit after greeting her
cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran brought a chair to the little table at which the other
two sat, threw himself into it, sighed and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Saturday night, the twenty-fifth, and in one
week from to-day, on Saturday, the second of December, I
must sail for England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Cousin Randolph, I know. And I am very sorry it
should be necessary that you should have to go—very. But
you will soon return,” sympathetically replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is about Judy,” frankly exclaimed Ran. “I have not
had a letter from her for nearly a month.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you yourself have told us of the uncertainty of the
mails.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and that might have been an explanation, and
therefore a kind of comfort, for failing to get a single letter
in time. But when three or four that I should have got
have failed to come, it is strange and alarming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither Cleve nor Palma found anything to answer to
this. They knew and felt that it was both “strange and
alarming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us hope that you will get a letter within a few
days,” at length ventured Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you may get one even to-morrow,” hopefully exclaimed
Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! And I may have to sail for England in the
most agonizing anxiety as to Judy’s fate!” said Ran with
a profound sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there is no reason for such an intense anxiety. She
is in excellent hands,” said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! but when I came away there was a talk of the intended
rising of the Indians! Good Heaven! the fort may
have been stormed and all hands massacred for all I know!”
exclaimed the youth, growing pallid at the very thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Randolph!” cried Palma in horror.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing of that sort could have happened without our
having heard of it before this. The authorities at Washington
would have received the news, and it would have been
in all the papers. Some survivor would have escaped to the
nearest telegraph station and sent the message flying to
Washington,” said Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes—certainly. But I never thought of that! It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>a real relief to me! I hope I may get a letter before I go!
If I do not, and could have my own way, I would sacrifice
the passage and wait here until I could hear from Judy.
But Mr. Walling says it is absolutely necessary that I
should go no later certainly than the day set for sailing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if a letter should come we will immediately send it
after you,” said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, cousin, dear; I know that you will do all
that you can. Well, I have learned one lesson from all
this,” said Ran so solemnly that both his companions looked
up inquiringly, and Palma asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Cousin Randolph?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is this: If Heaven ever should bring my dear Judy
and myself together again I will never part with her—no,
never while we both shall live! Nothing shall ever part us
again except the will of Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how about school and college that was to have prepared
you both for the sphere of life to which you are
called?” Palma inquired with some little amusement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, bother that! It was all the nonsense about ‘the
sphere of life to which we are called’ that parted Judy and
me! And it shall never part us again! We will go to
school and college, but we need not part and live in school
and college. We will marry and go to housekeeping in some
city where there are educational advantages. I will attend
the college courses. Judy shall have teachers at home.
And so we will live until we are polished up bright enough
to show ourselves to my grandfather’s neighbors and tenants
at Haymore. Then we will settle there for good, and no one
will ever know that the successors of Squire Hay were first
of all a pair of little ragamuffins and ignoramuses from a
California mining camp! Yes, that is what I will do, and
no prudence, and no policy, and no consideration for ‘that
sphere of life to which we are called,’ nor for anything
else but Judy herself, shall influence me! When we meet
again we shall be married out of hand and nothing but
death shall part us! When we meet again! But when will
that be? Ah, me!” sighed poor Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>There came a rap at the door, and the “boy” put in his
head and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lady and ge’men would come up, sir, which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>said there wasn’t no call to send up no card,” then withdrew
his head and ran away.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three cousins looked up to see a tall, martial-looking
man with a gray mustache, and clothed in a military overcoat
and fatigue cap, enter the room with a slender, graceful
girl, in a long gray cloth ulster and a little gray plush
hat, hanging on his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three companions stared for a moment, and then
Ran sprang up, overturning his chair in his haste, and
rushed toward them, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Col. Moseley! Judy! Oh, Judy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And in another instant Judy was pressed to his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, introduce us to your friends, Mr. Hay,” said the
colonel, taking off his cap and bowing to the lady and gentleman,
who had risen to their feet to receive the unknown
and unexpected guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, pardon me,” exclaimed Ran, raising Judy, drawing
her arm through his own and taking her up to his cousins.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. and Mrs. Stuart, this is Miss Judith Man, my betrothed.
Judy, darling, these are my Cousin Palma and her
husband,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was to be thought that the young girl would have made
her quaint, parish school courtesy; but she did not. She
bowed, blushed and smiled very prettily. Cleve Stuart
shook hands with her and said that he was very glad to see
her. But Palma drew the girl to her bosom and kissed her,
with a few murmured words of welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ran presented:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Col. Moseley, Mrs. Stuart, Mr. Stuart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And all shook hands in the old-time, cordial manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>And when all were seated, Col. Moseley in Ran’s vacated
chair at the little table with Cleve and Palma, and Ran
and Judy, side by side, on the little sofa near them, there
came the natural question from Stuart:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did you reach New York, colonel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At noon to-day,” replied Moseley.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At noon to-day, and I see nothing of Judy until eight
o’clock this evening!” exclaimed Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Patience, my dear fellow; I had to find you before I
could bring her. I arrived, with a large party, at noon, as
I said; took them all to an old-fashioned hotel downtown,
where the prices are not quite ruinous; left them all there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and went to hunt up you at your hotel, found that you had
left it, but could not find out where you had gone; went
back to own place and dined with my family; after dinner
went out to hunt up the Wallings, with the view of finding
you, and also of finding the furnished house I had commissioned
Walling to engage for me; looked in at the office first,
but found no one there but the janitor cleaning up; office
hours were over; Mr. Samuel Walling gone home to his
dinner; got his address; went to the house; found Mr. and
Mrs. Samuel Walling, who were as much amazed at seeing
me as if I had been a ghost risen from the dead. In fact,
they had not got my letter of advice, and, consequently, had
not engaged any furnished house for my tribe. However,
they insisted on making it all right for us. They told me
where to find you, Hay; and then when I said I must go
back to the hotel to pick up Judy, Mrs. Walling insisted on
going with me to see her old schoolmate and dear friend,
and she went with me. Well, in brief, when she met my
wife, nothing would do but she must take her and all the
girls home to her own house to stay until we can find a
home for ourselves. I and the boys remain at the hotel.
Judy is to join Mrs. Moseley and the girls at the Wallings’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, then, Judy is to do nothing of the sort. Judy is
to stay here with me. I am her natural protector under the
circumstances,” said little Palma, drawing herself up with
an assumption of matronly dignity that was very amusing
to the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, my dear lady. It shall be as you please, or
as Miss Judith pleases; only, I do not know how I shall
face Mesdames Walling and Moseley without taking her to
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will write a note and relieve you of responsibility in
the matter,” exclaimed Palma, rising and going toward a
little writing-desk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you have not consulted Miss Judith,” said the
colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I know she will stay with us,” exclaimed Palma,
going toward the girl and putting her arms around her
neck and murmuring:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will stay with us, will you not, dear Judy? I may
call you Judy, may I not? I have known you as Judy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>loved you as Judy, before I ever saw you. Shall I call you
Judy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure and ye may, ma’am!” exclaimed the girl with
cordial impetuosity; but then, catching herself up suddenly,
she blushed and added softly: “If you please, ma’am, I
should like you to call me so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma smiled, kissed her forehead, and then went to her
tiny desk and wrote the note to Mrs. Moseley.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel had but little time to stay, and soon arose to
say good-night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the way,” he said, “I had almost forgotten. I am
the bearer of an invitation for you all to come and dine with
us at Mrs. Walling’s to-morrow, at seven.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma looked at her husband, understood his eyes, and
answered for both:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love to Mrs. Walling, and we will go with much
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Col. Moseley shook hands all around, like the plain, old-fashioned
soldier that he was, and then went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>There remained Ran and Judy, sitting on the sofa, and
Cleve and Palma at the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lovers were comparing notes, giving in their experience
of the time while they were separated, speaking in
subdued tones that presently sank so low as to be quite inaudible
to any other ears than their own; so it might be
surmised that Ran was imparting to Judy his new scheme
of life for the future.</p>

<p class='c009'>The married pair at the table with the truest politeness
ignored the presence of the just reunited lovers, and took
up their occupations that had been interrupted by the visitors.
Cleve opened his book and resumed his reading, but
now in a lower tone, quite audible to Palma, but not disturbing
to Ran or Judy. He was reading Marmion, the scene
of the meeting between the pilgrim and the abbess on the
balcony. But Palma, knitting mechanically, could not
listen. She was seized with a terrible anxiety that filled her
mind and crowded out everything else. She had, from the
impulse of a warm heart, invited Judy to stay, and Judy
was staying.</p>

<p class='c009'>But where on the face of the earth was she to put Judy?
They had in their doll’s house of a flat but four tiny rooms—parlor,
kitchen and two bedrooms. What was to be done?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>How could she listen to the story the abbess was telling the
pilgrim, and the minutes passing so rapidly, and bedtime
coming on, and no bed to put her invited guest in? And
there was Cleve utterly unconscious of her dilemma, although
he knew as well as she did the extent—or rather
limits—of their accommodation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve finished the canto and closed the book in complacent
ignorance that Palma had not heard a word of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clock on the mantel struck eleven. It was a cheap
clock and it struck loudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran arose to bid good-night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really ought to beg your pardon for keeping you up.
But you will excuse me for this once,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, certainly! Certainly! Don’t go yet. We shall
not retire for hours. Oh, pray! pray! don’t go yet!” pleaded
Palma with her curly hair fairly stiffening itself on end;
for, when Ran had left, what, in the name of Heaven, was
she to do with Judy? Take the girl in with herself and
Cleve? Or lay her over Mrs. Pole on that narrow slab of a
cot that could not hold two side by side?</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma had got into a terrible dilemma which she feared,
by the creepy coldness of her scalp, was going to turn her
hair white!</p>

<p class='c009'>She would have been very much relieved if—after the old-fashioned
New England style—the betrothed lovers should
sit up all night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do, do, do stay longer!” she still pleaded, looking
beseechingly at Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ran was looking at his sweetheart, and replied
gravely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind! Too kind! And I thank you so
much! But, even for Judy’s sake, I ought to go. She is
very tired from her long journey. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he turned to go, Judy following him to the door of
the parlor, where, of course, they lingered over their adieus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Stuart got a chance to speak apart with Palma. He
looked into her dismayed face and broke into a little, low
laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! what in the name of goodness shall I do?” she exclaimed,
clasping her hands and gazing appealingly up into
his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he pitied her evident distress and answered:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Why, dear, you will have to share your own bed with
Miss Judy and give me a rug on the sofa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her face brightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cleve!” she exclaimed, “you are an angel of light in
a cutaway coat! You have saved my life—or reason!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then suddenly growing grave she added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the little sofa is so short, and you are so long!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t look so distressed, dear. The inconvenience
is nothing at all. And it is only for one night. To-morrow
I will see the janitor and try to get a room for our little
friend contiguous to our own, so that she may remain with
us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart spoke of incurring this additional expense with apparent
cheerfulness, although his small funds were nearly
exhausted, and his efforts to procure employment were quite
fruitless.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he said no more then, for Ran, who had lingered at
the door over his last words with Judy, now kissed her
good-night and went away, and the girl rejoined her friends
in the little parlor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='large'>PALMA’S NEW FRIEND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I will leave you for half an hour to make your arrangements,”
said Stuart to his wife; and he left the room
and went downstairs and out upon the sidewalk to take
the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy had thrown herself into an easy-chair and stretched
out her feet to the bright little fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma pushed the small sofa back against the wall, and
then went into the bedroom, from which she brought a cushion
and a rug. When she had arranged the sofa into a
couch she turned and looked at her guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy was nodding.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma went and laid her hand on the sleeper’s shoulder
and gently aroused her, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whenever you wish to retire, dear, your room is ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! sure, I thank ye, ma’am. Any time as shutes yourself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>will shute me,” replied Judy with a wide gape, waking
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, then,” said Palma, and she led the sleepy and
half-bewildered girl into the pretty little bedchamber, where
she had laid out a dainty night dress for her guest. Judy
waked up fully in the process of disrobing, and then her
hostess said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow you shall have a better accommodation, but
to-night you will share my room. I hope you won’t
mind it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Och, no, ma’am. Sure and haven’t I been used to pigging
in itself?” began Judy brightly, but she suddenly
checked herself and amended her phraseology—“I mean,
ma’am, I have been accustomed to close quarters in the
mining camp, and this is a palace compared to any place I
have ever seen before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a pretty little doll’s house as one could wish, for
dolls,” replied Palma with a laugh. “Not quite spacious
enough, however, for one who loves space.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which side am I to sleep on, ma’am?” inquired the girl
when she was ready for bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any side you wish, dear. But, Judy, please don’t call
me ‘ma’am.’ If you do I shall be obliged to call you ‘miss,’
and I should not like that, and I do not think you would
like it, either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fegs and I wouldn’t! Oh! that is to say, no, ma’am,
I should not. I should feel it to be cold and unkind of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then, Judy dear, do as you would be done
by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will, ma’am,” said the girl, getting into bed and lying
down on the side next to the wall and squeezing herself
against it to take up as little room as possible, “and indeed,
ma’am, since it displeases you, I will try to remember—never—to
call—you ma’am—again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The last word was scarcely audible, for as soon as Judy’s
head dropped on the pillow her eyes closed and she fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma returned to the parlor, drew the easy-chair to the
fire, and seated herself to wait for Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>He came in at length and dropped himself into the larger
easy-chair by Palma’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judy is fast asleep. She dropped asleep first in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>chair here, and afterward, when I got her to bed, she fell
asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow,” Palma told
him with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you?” inquired Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I am not at all sleepy. I feel too much elated by
the arrival of all these people. I wonder what Mrs. Pole
will think when she finds out that we have a visitor staying
with us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t she know, Palma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no, Cleve. She went to bed before the colonel
left us, and how could she know that the girl remained behind?
And I wonder what she will say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Palma, I think she will disapprove.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you don’t, Cleve?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all, dear. I am glad you took the girl in. We
will find a room for her to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The clock struck twelve, yet still the young couple sat
talking to each other like a pair of lovers loath to say good-night,
as any young “courting couple” could possibly be;
for, in fact, they were now sweethearts. Palma, we know,
had always loved Cleve; but only since their marriage had
Cleve been growing every day more in love with his wife.
So they sat and talked, or sat in silence over the fire, until
the clock struck two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear, you must really go to bed, even if you are
not sleepy,” said Stuart, rising and standing up, as much
as to say, “Here I shall stand until you go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You turn me out, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I turn you out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma stood on tiptoes to kiss him good-night. He lifted
her in his arms and kissed her again and again, and then
set her down, and she vanished through the damask portières
into the little bedroom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart threw off his coat and lay down on the sofa. It
was a short sofa with a low back and two arms. Cleve’s
head lay upon one arm and his legs dangled over the other.
The discomfort of the position would have kept him from
sleep even if the apartment had been quiet, which it was
not.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma’s entrance had waked Judy. The girl had had
three hours’ sound sleep and had waked up refreshed in
mind and body, delighted to find herself in such a rare,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>beautiful little room and with such a lovely companion.
She felt no inclination to sleep more just then—but to talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>A kindly yet indiscreet question from Palma set her
tongue going, and she talked on and never stopped until she
had told her whole story.</p>

<p class='c009'>As there was nothing but the red damask portières that
separated the little chamber from the little parlor, Stuart
heard the whole of that story; he could not help hearing it.
Once or twice he hemmed to let the narrator know that he
was awake and listening; but that made no difference to
Judy. She had no secrets. “All the birds of the air” were
welcome to hear her history. It was near daylight when
at length she had talked herself to sleep. As for Palma, she
had dozed through the narrative, though Judy had not suspected
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the first glinting of the rising sun’s rays through
the slats of the parlor blinds, Stuart gladly arose from his
uncomfortable couch and went into the little bathroom to
make his morning toilet.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had finished it, in returning to the parlor he
passed by the open door and saw that Mrs. Pole had risen,
tidied up her kitchen and got breakfast well under way.
He stepped in to tell her about their guest and send her
into the parlor to set the room to rights. Then he went
downstairs to take the air on the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole passed into the parlor to hoist the window, replenish
the fire, and restore the place to order before setting
the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her movements awoke the two sleepers in the next room.</p>

<p class='c009'>They arose laughing and talking, dressed themselves
quickly and came out into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole turned from the window she was just closing
to look at the stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma laughingly introduced the two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is our friend, Miss Judith Man, Poley. And,
Judy, darling, this is our dear Mrs. Pole, who is like a second
mother to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The elder woman wiped her clean hands on her clean
apron, and then gave the stranger a close clasp and a warm
welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Poley, dear, you can go and look after the breakfast,
and we will set the table. Miss Judith is quite at home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>with us, and knows as much about housekeeping as we do,”
said Palma brightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole made no objection, but left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Palma—and Judy following her example—began
to take the books off the center table and pile them in a
corner. Then they folded the table cover and laid it upon
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma went to the prettiest little doll’s corner cupboard
that ever was seen, opened a drawer in the lower part of it,
and took out a white damask cloth which she spread upon
the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she handed out the china, piece by piece, which
Judy took and arranged on the cloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, dear, what a little casket we live in,” said
Palma when the table was ready and the cupboard closed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, darlint, ye are a precious jewel yerself, and where
would ye be stored but in a casket itself?” demanded Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Stuart came up from below and greeted the
two young women cordially.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole brought in the breakfast and they sat down to
the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were scarcely seated when Ran entered, shook hands
all around, and took the fourth place at the table, which had
been prepared for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversation grew lively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When shall we see Mike?” inquired Ran at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! to-day, I hope,” replied Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does he know where to find us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He didn’t yesterday! No more did we! And he wint
with his friends—friends to a chape—cheap boarding-house
before the colonel found you out. But sure he will know
where we are by this time! The colonel will have told
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While they were yet speaking in walked the colonel with
Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the company arose from the table to receive them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Mike closed hands cordially at once, while the
colonel was shaking hands with Stuart, Palma, and Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ran introduced Mike to his cousins, who received
him heartily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, now, won’t you both sit down and take some
breakfast with us?” inquired Stuart and Palma in a breath.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Oh, thank you! I just got up from my breakfast to
bring Man here,” said the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And meself finished before I wint to his honor,” said
Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But do not let us disturb you. Pray, go on with your
own breakfast,” said Col. Moseley.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we have done!” replied Stuart, while Palma rang
the bell for Mrs. Pole to come and take away the service.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few minutes later they were all seated in the little parlor,
which the company of six nearly filled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how is the misthress this morning, sir?” inquired
Judy of the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! she has quite recovered from her fatigue and has
gone house-hunting with Mrs. Walling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the childher?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! well and delighted with the great city,” replied
Col. Moseley; and as Judy asked no more questions he
turned to Ran and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I find that you have had very little difficulty in prevailing
on the Messrs. Walling to recognize your rights, Hay!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None whatever, sir; thanks to your strong letter!” replied
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks to your strong proofs, rather. Who could withstand
such overwhelming evidence? But, Hay, in none of
your letters did you tell us who the rival claimant was, although
I asked you to do so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never got your letter containing such a request, sir,
or I should have complied with it. The reason why I never
volunteered the information was because the subject was a
painful one. And, by the way, has not Mr. or Mrs. Walling
told you who that impostor was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I have not had five minutes’ private conversation
with them yet. Mrs. Walling may have told my wife by this
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, colonel, the claimant was, not my Uncle James’
son, as I suspected, but a fraudulent adventurer whom we
have known as Gentleman Geff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gentleman Geff! Why, I thought he had been quite
killed by the same parties that half killed you, and that his
bones were buried in the old fort cemetery!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So did I. So did we all. But we were mistaken. The
body buried in the cemetery for Gentleman Geff’s was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>his, but that of some poor victim of border ruffianism, whose
identification we shall, perhaps, never discover, and Gentleman
Geff is alive and flourishing in stolen plumes on the
continent of Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me all about it!” exclaimed the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Ran went over the story of Gentleman Geff’s crimes,
already so well known to our readers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Col. Moseley listened with grave interest; Mike with
open-mouthed wonder, Judy in stupefaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know why one should ever be surprised at anything
that happens,” mused the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bedad, meself is only shurprised that I nivir had the
sinse to shuspect it,” remarked Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And he that particular about his clane linen! Sure, I
nivir less would have belaived it av sich a jintleman!”
sighed Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is the scoundrel now?” inquired the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somewhere in Europe on his bridal tour,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On his bridal tour?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then he told the story of Gentleman Geff’s felonious
marriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A fine account he will have to settle!” exclaimed the
colonel. “Two assaults, with intent to kill, one bigamy,
divers forgeries and perjuries, to say nothing of the fraudulent
claim of a name and estate to which he has no right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not take a single step toward prosecuting him,”
said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! you won’t! By the way, do you really sail on
Saturday?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, colonel, really. And, moreover, I mean to take
Judy with me. Yes, indeed, sir. She is more than wealth,
and rank, and culture, and every other worldly good.
Sooner than part again, with half a sphere between us, we
will get married first and go to school afterward,” said
Ran, taking Judy’s hand within his own and keeping a close
hold of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whe-ew! And what does Miss Judy say to that?” inquired
the colonel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, thin, sir,” began Judy—but her face flamed and
she mended her speech—“indeed, sir, I have consented to do
as Ran wishes. Why should I not? Absence has tried us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>He has graived—suffered, that is. And as for myself, sir,
there was many a time when I could have started to walk
clear across the continent to go to him just as I walked
through the wilderness to find him when he was wounded,
only it would not have been—been—right, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you mean really to marry this young fellow and
go to Europe with him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis—yes, if you please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you said out there at the fort that you would not do
it until—something or other, I have forgotten what.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until he had seen something of the world, sir, to be sure
of his own mind—that is what I mint—meant. And now
it is not as if Ran and myself had only met lately at a party
and took a sudden fancy to each other. We have known
each other for years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, sir,” said Ran, “you must not think that we have
given up the plan of education; for we have not. I have
talked it over with my Cousin Cleve here, and settled upon
a plan, to which Judy has agreed. We will marry, as I
said, before we sail for England. After we have visited
Haymore we will go to London, as being the place of places
where we can live in the strictest retirement, unknown and
untroubled, until education shall have fitted us to mingle
with society. After which we will go and settle at Haymore.
This is the best plan I can think of to keep us
united. And I will not entertain any plan that is to part
this dear, true girl from me, even for a season.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bravo, my boy! Even if I had a right to set up any
opposition to your wishes, I should not do it. And what is
to be done with Mike?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mike is my brother,” replied Ran. “He shall share with
me in any way he likes. He shall go to England and live
with us if he likes. Or stay here, and enter into any business
that he may choose and be fit for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Col. Moseley looked at Ran, and thought him the most
unselfish, the most unworldly individual he had ever seen in
all the days of his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so Ran was.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel soon took leave, expressing his pleasure in
the prospect of meeting his friends at Mr. Samuel Walling’s
that evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, young man, that I have shown you the way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>your sister’s abiding-place, you will not need my guidance
any longer. Good-day to you,” he said to Mike as he left
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-day, and many thanks for your shivility, sir,” returned
Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>It occurred to Ran then that perhaps Mike, in the simplicity
of his heart, was staying longer than was convenient
in the narrow quarters of his cousins; so very soon he
asked him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are Longman and old Dandy staying? I should
like to see them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they are at Markiss’, away down on Water Street.
They’d be proud to see you, Ran. Come with me, and I
will take ye straight to them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was exactly what Ran wished. He arose and bade
the two young women good-morning, and left the house
with his friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma and Judy began to think of making preparations
for the family dinner party at Mrs. Walling’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma took out her crimson cashmere dress and gave it
to Mrs. Pole to be brushed and shaken, sponged and pressed,
and looked over her small stock of lace and gloves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy looked down on her own brown traveling dress and
said ruefully:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This will never do to wear this evening. I have got a
pretty dark blue French merino; but it is in my trunk at
the hotel, and sure it might as well be in Aigypt—Egypt,
that is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Col. Moseley will be sure to send the trunk to you,” suggested
Palma. And even while she spoke a noise was heard
outside and a knock came to the door, and the janitor entered
the parlor, followed by a porter with the girl’s trunk
on his shoulders. When he put it down on the floor Stuart
paid and discharged him, and shortly after left the house
on his daily hopeless search for employment.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening Stuart, Palma, Hay, Judith, Col. and Mrs.
Moseley, Mr. James and Miss Betty Moseley met at dinner
at Mr. Samuel Walling’s. A happier party never gathered
around a table.</p>

<p class='c009'>After dinner the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room,
leaving the gentlemen to their wine.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>In the drawing-room Mrs. Moseley introduced the subject
of Ran and Judy’s proposed marriage. She said to Judy:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, we are all friends here—intimate friends, indeed—so
it is quite proper that I should speak plainly. My
young favorite, Mr. Hay, has taken counsel with me concerning
his wish to marry you and take you to Europe with
him. Am I right in supposing that this is your wish also?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis—yes, madam,” replied Judy, modestly lowering her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, dear, are you willing that Mrs. Stuart and myself
should make all the arrangements for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should be very grateful to you, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here! I am not going to be left out in the cold!”
exclaimed Augusta Walling, laughing and joining the circle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you are not! How should you be, when we
are hoping that the wedding breakfast will be served right
here in your house on Saturday morning next?” said Mrs.
Moseley, well knowing that she might take a much greater
liberty than that with her old schoolmate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be perfectly delightful!” exclaimed Mrs.
Walling. “I adore a wedding breakfast at home, and never
expected to enjoy one until my own daughter, now at
Vassar, grows up and gets married. Miss Judith, shall this
be so? Will you place yourself in my hands?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure and”—brightly exclaimed Judy, and then she
stopped suddenly, blushed and amended her speech—“I
should be glad and grateful, ma’am,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Mrs. Walling turned to Palma, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you will give me back your guest in time? You
are rather too young a matron to chaperon a bride-elect,”
she added with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you and my cousins please, dear Mrs. Walling. I
should myself be very happy to serve them, but I will not
stand in the way of another who can do so much better,”
replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a dear, unselfish angel!” exclaimed Mrs. Walling.
And then the four women formed themselves into a committee
of ways and means, and discussed wedding breakfasts,
trousseaus and so forth, treating Judy with as much
freedom, tenderness and liberality as if she had been their
own child, until the gentlemen came in and the subject was
dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The evening passed so pleasantly that it was late when
the party broke up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart, Palma, Ran and Judy returned to their flat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart had not been able to find a room for Judy. All
the rooms were in suites. One more night he had to sleep as
well as he could on the short sofa, while Judy shared
Palma’s bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the next day, toward the afternoon, Mrs. Walling
came for Judy, to take her to the Walling home to make
preparations for her marriage on Saturday.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Moseleys,” she said, “have secured a fine old manor
house at Fort Washington, about fifteen minutes by rail
from New York. It is completely furnished and in perfect
readiness for occupation. The family are in Europe, and
the house has been left in the care of an agent, who has
just kept it in perfect order. They leave us to-night; so
you see we have room for a score of young girls, if we could
find them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma made no objection to the departure of Judy, but
kissed her an affectionate good-by; and Mrs. Walling took
the girl and the girl’s little trunk away with her in the
luxurious family carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Ran forsook the Stuarts and spent that evening with
the Wallings, returning quite late to his suite of rooms on
their flat. But, under the circumstances, his cousins forgave
him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='large'>A WEDDING AND OTHER INCIDENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Stuart and Palma were both very glad and very grateful
that Mrs. Walling had undertaken all the responsibilities
of their cousin’s wedding. They knew that her means
were ample, and that Walling &#38; Walling were advancing,
and would continue to advance, any sum that Randolph or
Judith might require for their personal preparations. They
knew also that Mrs. Walling was sincerely delighted with
the idea of the wedding celebration at her own house;
whereas, had it been settled to come off at the Stuarts’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>apartments, Stuart, from impecuniosity, and Palma, from
inexperience, would have been very much embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling was in her element selecting a proper trousseau
and outfit for Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>She came in her carriage every morning to take Palma
out shopping with her and Judy. Mrs. Moseley could not
accompany the party; not because she was a little way out
of town, for the cars ran all the time and would have
brought her in in fifteen minutes, but because she was “up
to her eyes in business” settling her large family in their
new home.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Mrs. Walling, Palma, and Judy went out together
every day, until all the shopping was completed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy’s outfit was a very complete but not a very costly
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know, dear,” Mrs. Walling explained to Palma,
“that our little friend is not going at all into society for two
or three years to come. The young pair will live very quietly
somewhere, to advance their education, before they show
themselves to their neighbors at Haymore; and so she will
really need little more than a schoolgirl’s ‘kist.’ Her wedding
dress, of course, must be a pretty one, and her traveling
dress must be very nice, but the others plain and simple
and inexpensive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma agreed to the prudence of all this. And Judy
said never a word. She left her affairs entirely in the hands
of her two friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the lady shopped for Judy she shopped for herself
as well. But, after a day or two, she could not but notice
that Palma bought nothing; that she let all the tempting
goods, so pretty and so cheap, pass under her admiring eyes
unpurchased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter with the young one?” inquired Augusta
of herself. “Doesn’t she care for dress at all?” Then
she remembered that she had never seen Mrs. Stuart in but
two dresses, and very inexpensive ones at that, namely, an
India muslin, sometimes, in her evenings at home, and a
fine crimson cashmere for visiting. And then it occurred
to Augusta Walling that the Stuarts might be in straitened
circumstances; and her heart was touched with sympathy
for the beautiful young woman who saw so many
attractive articles of adornment pass under her eyes or be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>bought by others without being able to buy one of them.
And she wondered how she might make Palma a pretty
present without giving offense.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate the rôle of a pretended benefactress. I should
shrink from such an imputation. Lovely little creature!
how elegant she would look in a ruby velvet, with duchess
lace! And she shall have it! Yes, that she shall! And I
will take the risk of being snubbed and stood in a corner for
my impertinence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The outcome of the lady’s resolution was this: After she
had set down Palma at the Stuarts’ apartments, and taken
Judy home to the Walling house, she set out on a second
shopping expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The same night, while Stuart was taking his usual walk
up and down the pavement before the house, and Palma sat
in her little room stitching fresh edges on frayed collars and
cuffs, one of Lovelace &#38; Silkman’s young ladies arrived at
the apartment home, followed by a boy with a large bandbox,
and asked for Mrs. Cleve Stuart. She was brought up
in the elevator and ushered into the presence of Palma, who
arose to receive the unexpected visitor, staring a little. The
stranger merely nodded to the lady, then, without any preface,
she took the bandbox from the boy, set it on a chair,
untied, unwrapped and opened it, and took from it a glorious
suit of dark, bright blue damassé velvet, trimmed with
satin, and spread it over a chair, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it is convenient, I would like to have you try it on
now, ma’am, so that I may make any alterations that may
be necessary before I leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I——” began the wondering Palma, when she was
suddenly interrupted by the dressmaker exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I beg your pardon! I forgot!” And she handed a
note addressed to Mrs. Cleve Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma took it in perplexity, opened it, and read:</p>
<p class='c012'>“Beauty to the beautiful! To Palma Stuart, with the
true love of Augusta Walling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Palma was touched, melted, delighted all at once. She
had never had, nor ever expected to have, so superb a dress.
She was but a child in some things. She could not speak
for surprise, gratitude and embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>But the matter-of-fact young woman from the suit department
of Lovelace &#38; Silkman’s went on to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were very sorry that we had not a ruby velvet made
up, but the lady who gave us your order said that there
would be no time to make up one, and she selected this;
and I really think, madam, that this shade of mazarine blue
will be quite as becoming to your brunette style as garnet
or ruby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is beautiful! It could not be more beautiful!” exclaimed
Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you try it on now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma arose and the dressmaker helped to relieve her of
her cashmere dress and induct her into the velvet.</p>

<p class='c009'>But slight alteration was necessary—the front breadth
shortened, the sleeves shortened, the side seams of the waist
taken in—that was all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young dressmaker laid off her hat and her wraps, and
took from her little hand-bag needle, sewing silk, scissors
and thimble, and sat down to work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Palma, having nothing else to occupy herself with
while the dressmaker sat there, began idly to rummage
among the silver tissue paper in the bottom of the big bandbox,
and there she found another box—a smaller one—which
she took out to examine. It had her name on it. She
opened the box and found a fichu and pocket handkerchief
of duchess lace, a pair of the finest white kid gloves, a lovely
fan, and a little turban of velvet and satin to match her
dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dressmaker soon finished her task, folded the dress,
returned it to the box, and took her leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Palma started up, like the delighted child that she
was, opened the box again, took out the elegant dress,
spread it all over the sofa to display its beauties to the best
advantage, and called in Mrs. Pole to admire it; and when
that good woman had risen to as much enthusiasm as she
was capable of—for a suit—and returned to her own dominions,
Palma still left it there, that Stuart might be regaled
with the vision when he should come in.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Cleve did come in and was shown the present and
the note that came with it he looked rather grave; he did
not like presents, would much rather that his pretty little
wife had continued to wear her shabby red cashmere, rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>than be indebted to any one for a sapphire velvet; but it
was too late to prevent her acceptance of it now, so he quickly
cleared his brow and admired the dress to her heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c009'>On that same evening Ran was, as usual, spending the
hour with Mrs. Walling and Judy. There was no other
company. Ran had a secret source of distress, and it was
this—his humble, faithful friends down at Markiss’ Hotel,
in the lower part of the city. They certainly did not belong
to the Walling “set.” Conventionally, they were a long,
long way below that set; yet Ran wanted them to be present
both at his wedding and at the wedding breakfast, and
that wedding was to be celebrated at one of the most “fashionable”
churches in the city; and that wedding breakfast
was to be given at Mrs. Walling’s. How could Ran ask
that very fine lady to invite his humble friends? And,
on the other hand, how could he slight those faithful
friends? Mike, his brother-in-law expectant, must come, of
course; that was to be taken for granted, and then Longman,
who had rescued him on the night when he was shot,
and who had actually saved his life—Longman ought certainly
to come. And, finally, poor old Andrew Quin ought
not to be left—the only one—“out in the cold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Ran was turning these matters over in his mind
he was not noticing what Mrs. Walling was doing. That
good lady sat at a small writing-desk busy with note paper
and envelopes. Presently she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Randolph, dear, give me the address of those good
friends of yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Friends, madam!” exclaimed Ran, the more taken by
surprise that he had been just thinking of them. It seemed
to him that the lady must have read his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, those old friends of yours who came on with Judy
and the Moseleys and are boarding somewhere down in the
city while waiting for their steamer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! yes, madam! You mean Samson Longman and
Andrew Quin? They are with Michael at Markiss’ on
Water Street. I do not know the number.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is not necessary. I am sending them invitations
to the wedding and the breakfast; for though, of course,
such a hasty affair as this is will not admit of much ceremony
and elaboration, yet they must be present. There will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>be the Moseleys, the Stuarts, ourselves and your friends
from Markiss’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should tell you beforehand that those friends of mine
come from a mining camp, and though good and true as
men can be, they are rough and plain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear boy, I have told you who is coming, and
so you may know that these friends will meet no one in our
house who will be so silly as to look down upon them for
being rough and plain. Really, Ran, dear, it ought not to
be necessary for me to say this,” concluded the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>For all answer, Randolph Hay went to her side, raised
her hand and pressed it to his lips with reverential tenderness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy looked up in her face with eyes full of tears and
murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord in heaven bless you, sweet and lovely lady!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling smiled deprecatingly at this effusiveness
and patted Judy gently on the head. Then she turned to her
writing-desk and wrote her informal notes. These were the
only invitations the lady had written. The few others to the
members of the two families more immediately concerned
had been verbal ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she had finished directing the envelopes she handed
them over to Ran, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The letter box is directly on your way home; will you
mind dropping them in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will take charge of them with pleasure,” said Ran, and
as the hour was late he arose, said good-night and left the
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ran did not drop the notes in a letter box. He
walked over to Sixth Avenue, hailed a car, boarded it and
rode down as far as that car would take him, then got out
and walked to Markiss’; for he was anxious that his friends
should get their bids as soon as possible. He found Mike,
Longman, and Dandy all sitting smoking in the grimy back
parlor behind Markiss’ bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>He entered and sat down among them. There happened
to be no other guests in the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, boys, did you think I had forgotten you?” inquired
Ran, really remorseful for not having sought them
out before.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“If we did we excused you, under the circumstances,”
replied Longman, speaking for the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose Mike has told you that I am to marry his
sister on Saturday morning—that is, the day after to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ay! trust Mike for that!” cried old Dandy with a
little giggle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I have come to-night to bring you invitations to
be present at the ceremony in the church and afterward at
the breakfast at the house. And, boys, you must be sure
to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where am I to get the widding garment proper for
the occasion? Sure, there’s no time to be cutted and fitted
and made dacint to appear in sich grand company, though I
thank the lady all the same,” said Andrew Quin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Dandy! Don’t you know that you are in New
York, where you can be fitted out for a wedding or a funeral
or an Arctic expedition in five minutes—more or less?”
laughed Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; it’s more or less, I’ll allow. But I do reckon I can
get a ready-made suit of clothes raisonable enough here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly you can! But you must let me see to that,
Dandy. I will be down here again to-morrow. And, lest
I should forget to tell you, I must do so now. On Saturday
morning you must let Mike bring you to the church. He
knows where it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Misther Hay,” said Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, Longman, you have not promised, but you will
come, I am sure. My friends uptown wish to make the acquaintance
of the Nimrod who saved my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. Hay!” laughed the giant deprecatingly. “But
I shall be proud to come to your wedding,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ran bade them good-night and went home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day—Friday—was the last before the wedding
and the sailing. There were yet a few articles to be purchased,
and so Mrs. Walling got ready to go on her usual
morning shopping round. She asked Judy to put on her
hat to go with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not intend to call for Palma on this occasion; a
feeling of delicacy withheld her from going into the way of
her thanks.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while the carriage was standing at the door, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>while Mrs. Walling was waiting in the parlor for Judy to
join her, Mrs. Cleve Stuart was announced and entered the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma went straight up to Mrs. Walling with outstretched
hands and glowing eyes and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How shall I thank you for the rich, beautiful dress—the
soft, lovely, caressing dress—that folds me around with
the feeling of a friend’s embrace—your embrace?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer the lady drew the speaker to her bosom and
kissed her, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you to know,” continued Palma, “that I feel
more comfort in this than I should if I had bought it myself
out of boundless riches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Mrs. Walling kissed her, laughing this time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every time I put it on I shall feel your love around
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The elder lady pressed both the younger one’s hands and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are going out to try to find a suitable sea cloak for
Judy. We must find an extra heavy one. It will be terribly
cold crossing the ocean at this season. They will be on the
banks of Newfoundland in the first days of December.
Will you go with us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure,” said Palma. And as Judy now entered
the room, ready dressed for the drive, they arose to go out.
But just at that moment Mrs. Duncan was announced and
came in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both Mrs. Walling and Palma received her as cordially
as if she had not interrupted their departure. Mrs. Walling
then introduced:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My young friend, Miss Judith Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, my dear? I am glad to see you,” said
the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy bowed and smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are going out. Don’t let me detain you. I was on
my way down to Fourteenth Street to do a little shopping
and just dropped in here to tell you a piece of news; but
I can take another opportunity,” Mrs. Duncan explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! Pray do not! We should die of suspense!
Pray, sit right down and open your budget. Our errand
can wait as well as yours. It is only shopping. And when
you are ready for yours you would oblige us by taking the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>fourth seat in our carriage, so that we can go together,”
Mrs. Walling pleaded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Duncan laid down her muff and shopping bag and
seated herself in one of the luxurious armchairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling rang a bell and gave an order:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring coffee into this room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And presently the four women had tiny china cups in
their hands, sipping hot and fragrant Mocha, three of them
listening while the fourth told her news.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is about Jennie Montgomery, the true wife of the
counterfeit Randolph Hay——” began the speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! yes!” eagerly exclaimed Mrs. Walling and Palma
in a breath, while Judy looked up in eager curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know, without any one’s planning—unless fate be
some one—that Jennie and her child were passengers on the
same steamship, and even in the same cabin, with her fraudulent
husband and his false bride?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! yes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said when I discovered that complication that those
elements were as explosive as dynamite. Neither could
have expected the presence of the other on the steamer, and
so I was really anxious to hear what happened when Miss
Leegh and her ‘bridegroom’ met his lawful wife and child
on the ship, on the ocean, whence neither could escape without
jumping into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, have you heard?” impatiently demanded Mrs.
Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I have just received a long letter from Jennie,
dated November 15th. She had been at home four weeks
before she found time to write to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And——” breathlessly exclaimed Mrs. Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She met her husband on the deck of the steamer. She
was as much astonished as he was confounded. But I had
better read her letter to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the visitor drew a thickly packed envelope, with a
foreign stamp, from her pocket, and read the pages describing
Jennie’s voyage, her meeting with her husband and Miss
Leegh on the <em>Scorpio</em>, and her arrival at home in her
father’s new vicarage, as these events are already known to
our readers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To think of Jennie’s self-control and forbearance!”
concluded Mrs. Duncan.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“And to think of Lamia Leegh’s insolence in trying to
patronize her, the real wife of her own ‘brevet’ bridegroom!”
exclaimed Mrs. Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to think of the man’s assurance in carrying off matters
with such a high hand!” remarked Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Och, sure, and himself had always the impidince av the
divil, had Gintleman Geff!” exclaimed Judy, surprised into
her dialect; then, suddenly aware of her “backsliding,” she
clapped her hand to her mouth a minute too late and looked
frightened; but as she saw that neither of her friends were
in the least disturbed she felt relieved, while the visitor
evidently thought that the brogue had been humorously assumed
for the occasion, for she replied in kind:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, has he—the thaif av the worruld!” Then, turning
to Mrs. Walling, she continued: “What an active fate there
seems to be at work here! Did you see the significance of
the latter part of Jennie’s letter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course; her father has left Medge, in the south
of England, and is in temporary charge of Haymore vicarage,
in the north of England,” replied Mrs. Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And our Gentleman Geff of the many wives and aliases,
in trying to escape his one real wife and avoid her father
by getting off the steamer at Queenstown will unwittingly
rush into their power again the moment he sets foot within
his stolen estate at Haymore. Now, if his lawful wife had
been anybody else there might be a chance for a show of
fight. But the daughter of the Vicar of Haymore!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” exclaimed Mrs. Walling, drawing her breath hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie writes of the great preparations they are making
at Haymore to receive the usurping squire, who is now expected
to arrive with a large party of invited friends for
the Christmas holidays, little knowing that he will there
meet his lawful wife and her avenging, priestly father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And confront the lawful heir of Haymore with the more
terrible family solicitors,” laughed Mrs. Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then Mr. Randolph Hay is really going over at once to
take possession of his estates?” inquired the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; he sails on Saturday; but not alone—he takes his
wife with him. He will be married on Saturday morning
and embark in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, indeed! That is news. I had heard no rumor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>his being engaged, or even attentive to any of our girls.
Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My young friend here,” replied Mrs. Walling, pointing
to Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Duncan jumped up and kissed the girl with effusions
and congratulations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy blushed and smiled and bowed, but did not venture
to speak again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wedding is to be quiet. We don’t want a second
edition of the ‘princely nuptials’ of ‘Mr. Randolph Hay’
and Miss Lamia Leegh. They, we think, have done enough
in that way ‘for the honor of the family.’ Our wedding
must be very plain. There are ‘no cards.’ I will not say
there will also be ‘no cake, no nothing.’ So, as you are interested,
if you will drop in, ‘promiscuously,’ at the ‘Little
Church Around the Corner’ about ten o’clock to-morrow
morning, you will witness one of the happiest, though not
one of the grandest, weddings on record.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall do myself that pleasure without a doubt,” replied
Mrs. Duncan.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she arose and took up her muff and hand-bag to
intimate that she was ready to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the four ladies entered the close carriage that was
waiting at the door and went on their shopping expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was perfectly successful, even to the sea cloak, a heavy
cloth one, reaching from head to heel, having long sleeves
and hood, and lined throughout with fur.</p>

<p class='c009'>They took Mrs. Duncan to her door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is one thing I would rather see than the wedding,”
said Mrs. Duncan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what is that?” inquired Augusta Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The circus at Haymore Court when Mr. Randolph Hay
and his wife arrive there and meet Gentleman Geff and
Miss Lamia Leegh.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='large'>A BLITHE BRIDAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was a splendid winter morning. The snow, which had
fallen thickly during the night, was now frozen hard on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>ground, the housetops and the trees, and sparkled like
frosted silver sprinkled with diamond dust in the dazzling
sunshine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling’s household was astir. They were to have
an early family breakfast before dressing to go to church.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling and her young protégée met in the breakfast
room. Judy was pale and nervous.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, my dear. Do you see that the clouds
have gone with the night? A good omen for you, according
to the folklore—‘Blessed is the bride that the sun shines
on,’” said the lady as she drew the girl to her bosom and
pressed a kiss on her brow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma’am, I have prayed the Lord to bless the day for
Ran’s sake, but my heart misgives me, ma’am,” sighed
Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is very natural, but in your case very unreasonable,
my child. I never knew nuptials more promising for future
happiness than are yours and Randolph’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but, ma’am, am I a fit wife for a gentleman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not for every gentleman; for there are not so many
gentlemen who would be as worthy of you as Randolph Hay
is. But why should you think that you are not fit for him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma’am, I am only a poor, ignorant girl, and, with
all the pains you and Mrs. Moseley have taken with me, I
have not been able to improve much. Only yesterday I forgot
my manners before the strange lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean that you fell for a moment into the sweet dialect
of your childhood? That did no harm, Judy. And,
besides, when you go to London you will soon drop it altogether.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are to live in retirement, to be sure, until we are
both trained for society, I know. But still, for all that, I
fear I am doing Ran a wrong to marry him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, Judy! You and Randolph were engaged to
be married to each other, I think, while you were both in
the miners’ camp—you a miner’s sister; Ran a miner and
the partner of your brother. You, neither of you, dreamed
of any higher position or better fortune than luck in the
mines might bring you. Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then. Now suppose that it had been to you,
instead of to Randolph, that the unexpected fortune had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>come? Suppose that some nobleman of high rank and
wealth had suddenly come forward and claimed you as his
lost child and heiress, would you then have broken off with
poor Ran, because he was only a poor miner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! No! No!” cried Judy with flashing eyes and rising
excitement. “I nivir could a bin such a baste av the
wurruld!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she suddenly stopped and clapped her hands to her
lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if Randolph had taken it into his head that he, a
poor miner, was no fit husband for you under your changed
circumstances, what would you have done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should have broken me harrt entirely!” exclaimed
Judy, falling again into dialect, as she always did when
strongly moved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet you can talk about not being a fit wife for
Randolph, just because, since his engagement to you, he
has come into a fortune. My dear, you should consider
your betrothal so sacred that no change of fortune could be
able to affect it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see it, ma’am! I see it! And I will say no more
about it,” said Judy, smiling through her timid tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now we will have breakfast,” said Mrs. Walling,
rising and ringing the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tray was brought in at one door, while Mr. Walling
came in at the other, and the three sat down to breakfast,
the master of the house merely greeting the guest with a
kindly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, my dear,” as he took his seat at the
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as breakfast was finished they separated to dress
for church.</p>

<p class='c009'>I would like, also, to give my reader a glimpse of the
young bridegroom-expectant on this the morning of his
wedding day, in his temporary home in the apartment house
occupied by Stuart and Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three young people breakfasted together in the little,
elegant parlor of the Stuarts’ suite of rooms, Mrs. Pole
waiting on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran’s face shone with joy that he could not hide; Cleve’s
and Palma’s were bright with sympathetic smiles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran had entreated Mike Man to come and share his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>rooms at these flats until the wedding day and the embarkation
for Europe, but Mike had steadily refused, declaring
that, well as he loved his brother-in-law, he would be out of
place among Ran’s fine friends, and that he would feel more
at home “along wid Samson and Dandy.” Mike had decided
to accompany these old friends to Europe, in the second
cabin of the same steamer on which Ran had taken a
stateroom in the first cabin for himself and his bride. These
three miners were going home to the old country to settle
there. Different motives actuated the three. Old Dandy
wished to spend his declining years among old friends.
Longman wanted to return to his aged and widowed mother.
Mike could not stay behind all his friends, and must go with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>What each was to do on the other side of the ocean was
not very clear, even to themselves. Each had a little money
saved up. Dandy thought he would sink his savings in a
life annuity. Longman hoped to get a gamekeeper’s place
on some estate. Mike wanted to go to school for a little
while. He was really nineteen years old, but so small and
slender that he might easily have passed for a schoolboy.
But he meant to keep near his mining “pards,” so as not to
“inthrude” on Ran and Judy and their fine friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Vainly had faithful Ran combated this resolution. Mike
had been firm, and Ran had to yield the point.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, as Ran sat at table with Stuart and Palma, the
latter said to him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You and Judy will be married as Cleve and myself
were—without bridesmaid or groomsman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Ran; “but it is not my fault or Judy’s. I
wanted Judy’s brother, my old partner, Mike Man, to be
my groomsman, which would have been right enough; but
Mike stoutly refused. If Mike had consented to stand up
with me, then Judy might have had a bridesmaid in one of
the Moseley young ladies. But, no; Mike was as stubborn
as a mule. To be sure, I know that Mr. Jim Moseley and
Miss Betty Moseley would have kindly stood up with us,
but Judy said no; and so we must stand up alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is just as well. And now, my dear,” said Palma,
rising from her seat with a pretty little matronly air of
authority, “as you have finished your breakfast, you had
better go and dress yourself. Your carriage was ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>at half-past nine, I think. When you have finished, come
to me that I may put the last touches on your toilet—twirl
the curls and mustache, and pin the boutonnière, as you
have no valet. Though, I suppose, you will set up some
Monsieur Frangipanni as your personal attendant and
dresser.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Cousin Palma. Never! Never! I should
be too much in awe of such a grand dignitary,” said Ran,
laughing, as he left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a happy dog he is, my dear,” exclaimed Stuart to
his wife as they also retired to dress for the wedding.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, at this same hour, in an upper room at
Markiss’ Hotel on Water Street, another scene of preparation
was going on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Samson Longman, Andrew Quin, and Michael Man were
dressing for the wedding.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three men were fresh from the bath and the barber.
Longman had his hair cut and his fine, flowing beard
dressed, and, with his strong, regular features and his clear,
blue eyes, looked a very handsome colossus, indeed. He wore
a fashionable dress suit of black cloth, with a vest of black
satin, a small white tie, a tea rose in his buttonhole, white
kid gloves and patent leather boots.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked every inch a gentleman, as he really was.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy had had his red hair and side whiskers trimmed
and dressed. He also wore a dress suit of exactly the same
style of Longman’s, even to the little details of the white
tie, tea rose, kid gloves and patent leathers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike, with his short, dark, curly hair neatly arranged, his
fresh face, innocent of beard or mustache, and his slight
figure in a dress suit proper to the occasion, looked like
a boy got up for a birthday party, or a freshman ready for
his first college exhibition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Mike! Stop admiring yourself and hurry up.
Dandy, come! It is nine o’clock, and time to start if we
are to reach the church and get seated in time to see the
wedding party come in,” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, Lorrd! But me courage has sunk down into the
bottom av me boots! What would ail me to be pushing
meself amongst gentlefolk, anyway?” exclaimed the nervous
old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because it is my own Ran and Judy’s wedding, sure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and you are invited. And they would feel hurt by your
absence,” replied Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, Lorrd, I wouldn’t mind the church so much. Sure,
ivirybody’s free to go into a church. But it’s the breakfast.
Sure, an’ I nivir sat down to the table wid gentlefolks in
all my life, and wouldn’t know more’n the babe just born
how to behave myself, Lorrd! and if all tales be thrue,
gentlefolks’ ways at table is that diffunt from our’n!”
sighed Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose they eat, and drink, and talk, and laugh pretty
much as other people do. Take courage, Dandy, old man.
Just look at yourself in the glass! Why, you might be a
Wall Street millionaire, or a college professor, or a United
States Senator, to look at you,” laughed Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know!” exclaimed Dandy with a self-satisfied smirk
after glancing at the mirror. “Sure, ‘fine feathers make
fine birds!’ And it is not how I look, at all, at all, but how
I’m to behave, what I’m to say, and what I’m to do. That’s
what bothers me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, bosh! You needn’t do anything nor say anything
unless you like to. As for behaving, just watch other people
and behave as they do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, that’s a first-rate idea o’ your’n, Longman—first-rate.
And I’ll jist be guided by that. I’ll watch the gentry,
and behave jist as they do, and thin I can’t do amiss!”
exclaimed Dandy, brightening up.</p>

<p class='c009'>A very dangerous rule, with many unsuspected exceptions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now put on your overcoats and draw your woolen
mittens over your white kids, and come along, you two, or
we shall be late,” said Longman, who had already put on
all his outer garments and stood ready to march.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the three men were quite ready they went downstairs
together, walked over to the Fourth Avenue cars,
boarded one and rode uptown; got out at Blank Street, and
walked to the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no sign about the building to indicate a wedding
for that morning. The doors were closed, and there
was not a carriage nor a human being near the sacred
building.</p>

<p class='c009'>The truth is that the Wallings and all concerned in the
affair had kept the intended wedding not only out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>papers but out of all gossiping circles. They did not want
to have a sensational supplement to the magnificent pageantry
of the grand Hay-Leegh wedding. And their reticence
had even extended to a firm refusal to indorse any
journalistic report of the appearance of the rightful claimant
to the Haymore estate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you think we hev bin afther making a mistake in
the place, Mr. Longman?” inquired Dandy, looking mistrustingly
up to the closed and silent building.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; we’re the first that’s come, that’s all. Walk in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so saying he led the way, opening first the great
black walnut outer door and then the red cloth inner door
and entering the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>There they found the sexton, who asked them for cards.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman produced the three informal notes written by
Mrs. Walling, and the sexton, after looking at them, marshaled
the three men up the aisle, between empty pews, to
seats near the altar, where they sat down.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had become accustomed to the “dim religious
light” of the interior, they perceived that they themselves
were the only persons in the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see that we are early,” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sure, thin, I’m not sorry. I can compose the
narves av me,” replied Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>They drew off their overcoats, folded them, and put them
under the seats, shoved their silk hats after the coats, and
then took off their woolen mitts, rolled them up, and put
them in their pockets, and posed themselves for the scene
expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently the door opened and quite a large party entered,
and were led by the sexton to the front row of pews
before the chancel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the bowld Col. Moseley and his tribe, sure,” said
Mike in a low voice to his companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the tribe, indeed. The colonel, his wife and ten of
his girls and boys. The two youngest children had been
left at home on account of their tender age. The colonel’s
wife wore her Sunday suit of brown satin, with a brown
velvet bonnet and a rich old India shawl that had been an
heirloom in her family, having come down to her from her
great-grandmother. Her many daughters wore plain cardinal-red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>or navy-blue dresses, with plush coats and felt
hats to match.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next entered a single pair, unknown to Longman and
Dandy, but not to us. They were Mr. and Mrs. Cleve
Stuart. Palma wore her lovely suit of navy-blue demassée
velvet, with turban to match.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were provided with seats to the left of the Moseleys.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few minutes after them came a lady alone. She was
Mrs. Duncan, in a plum-colored satin dress and a sealskin
coat and cap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, just as the organ began to peal forth a magnificent
wedding march, streamed in two processions from two
opposite points.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, out from the vestry door came two white-robed
clergymen, with open books in their hands, followed by the
bridegroom, in evening dress, with a white rose in his buttonhole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, thin, see till our broth av a b’hoy! Sure, don’t his
face shine like the morning starr itself?” whispered Dandy
to his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman looked and saw Ran, with his brow radiant with
frank happiness which he did not think of suppressing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whish! Look down the aisle itself! There comes me
swate swishter! Och! what an angel!” murmured Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman looked and smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy turned his head and caught his breath. He had
never in all his life seen anything half so lovely as little
Judy in her bridal array. And yet her dress was simple
enough. She wore a plain white silk, trained; a white tulle
overskirt, looped with sprays of orange buds; a white tulle
veil, fastened above her curly, black hair with sprigs of
orange buds; and on her neck and arms a set of pearls given
her by Ran. Her eyes were cast down until their long,
sweeping, black lashes lay on her slightly flushed oval
cheeks. She came slowly, leaning on the arm of Samuel
Walling, who was to give her away.</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt her brother would have been asked to perform
this service, but that he was under age. And, besides, he
would have shrunk from the honor of taking so conspicuous
a part in the ceremony, since he would not even officiate
as groomsman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behind them came Mrs. Samuel Walling, in a superb suit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of ruby brocaded velvet, with turban to match. She was
leaning on the arm of her brother-in-law, Mr. William
Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two clergymen advanced to the altar railing with
open books in their hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bridegroom met the bride and took her hand; both
bowed to the officiating ministers, and then knelt down on
the hassocks before the altar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their immediate friends drew around them. The company
in the pews stood up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike bent eagerly, breathlessly forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ceremony began. It continued amid a breathless silence,
unbroken except by the voices of the officiating ministers
and responses of the kneeling pair before them, and
the short reply of the “church father” in bestowing “this
woman” upon “this man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After the benediction was pronounced friends crowded
around the newly wedded young pair with congratulations
that were not merely conventional, but earnest, heartfelt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike crept out of his pew, glided easily through the
crowd, and stood before his sister and brother-in-law, mute,
unable to speak, still looking like a very shy schoolboy at
his college exhibition.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ran seized his hand and shook it heartily, and held
it fast while he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mike—dear boy—we were always brothers in heart, and
now we are brothers in reality! Are you not going to embrace
your sister? She is not less your sister because she
is my wife, but more so, for she has married your bosom’s
everlasting brother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike then turned to Judy, who opened her arms and
folded him to her heart in a warm embrace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman and Dandy hung back for a little while, and
then the old man stood up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t stand it at all, at all! Sure, I must go and spake
to the darlints!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And out of the pew he went, and up to the chancel, where
“fine” friends were still surrounding the young pair.</p>

<p class='c009'>They made way for the eager old man as he pushed
through the group and confronted Ran and Judy, offering
each a hand and crying with emotion:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve come to wish ye the blissing av the Lord and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>His holy saints, me brave bhoy and gurrul—I mane Misther
and Misthress Randolph Hay av Hayti!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Judy took each a hand of the old miner and
said something inarticulate in kindly thanks. Then, seeing
Longman standing behind and towering above Dandy, Ran
held up his hand and the colossus came forward and offered
his congratulations, which both Ran and Judy received
with much hearty feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not forget, Longman, that I never should have
lived to see this happy day but for you,” said Ran, warmly
pressing his hands, while Judy’s smile expressed all that she
also would have said if she could have spoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my young friends,” said Mr. Samuel Walling,
approaching the group, “we must not keep the reverend
gentlemen waiting; we must go into the vestry room and
sign the register.” And he drew Judy’s arm within his
own and carried her off, followed by Ran and the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>When this form was completed the small company left
the church.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were but two carriages waiting before the door.
One was Mrs. Walling’s, in which she had brought the bride
to the church; the other was Ran’s, in which he was going to
take his wife back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Walling stood until she had seen Ran hand Judy
into the clarence and take his seat beside her, when she
turned to William Walling and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! I would like to give you a seat back to the house;
but I want to take in Mr. and Mrs. Stuart. Go up in the
street car—that is a good fellow! And while you are at it
see after those poor fellows from the mines. Get them into
the same car with yourself, so that they won’t miss their
way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right!” exclaimed good-humored Mr. Will. “Where
are the bears?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There they are!” she said, nodding toward the three
men coming from the church door. “Go and introduce
yourself to them, and then you will be capable of bringing
them up to the house and presenting them to your brother
and myself. They are great friends of Ran, you know. One
of them saved his life! They came with the colonel’s family
and Judy from California. Now be off!” added the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>lady as she saw her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Stuart, approaching,
and went to meet them, saying to Palma:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, I have been waiting for you to come out. I
have two vacant places in my carriage. I should be much
pleased if you and Mr. Stuart would take them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you very much. You are very kind,” said
Palma, accepting the offer as frankly as it was given.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart bowed—there was nothing left for him to say or
do. The “ladies” had made the arrangement! That was
enough for the Southern gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>They entered the carriage with Mr. and Mrs. Walling
and were driven rapidly uptown.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel’s large family crowded into a street car.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Walling, Longman and Dandy found seats in another
car.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so the wedding guests went their way to the Walling
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arrived there, the ladies and children, only nine in all,
were shown into an upper room to lay off their bonnets and
wraps and add bouquets and white kid gloves to their
toilets.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentlemen, ten in all, were shown into another room
for light changes.</p>

<p class='c009'>And after half an hour’s performances they all filed
down to the drawing-room, where they found their host
and hostess, and the bride and groom, waiting to receive
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here also the wedding presents were on view for a short
time, before being packed and dispatched to the steamer,
which was to be effected while the company should be at
table. There was a silver tea service from Mr. and Mrs.
Walling; a silver salver from Mr. Will; a gold watch and
chain from Col. and Mrs. Moseley; a box of fine handkerchiefs
from Cleve and Palma Stuart—this was the same
box that had been given by Cleve to Palma months before,
but not a handkerchief had been disturbed, and having
nothing else to give she gave it now, with Cleve’s consent.
There was a gold chain and cross from Mike; a pretty hand-bag
from Longman, a workbox from Dandy, and various
dainty trifles, mostly of their own manufacture, from the
Moseley girls and boys.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>A little later the butler slid back the rolling portières and
announced breakfast, which was laid in a long rear room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wedding party—host and hostess, bride and groom,
and guests, filed in and seated themselves at the table—nine
on each side, host and hostess at the head and foot. Ran
and Judy sat on the right side of Mrs. Walling, Col. and
Mrs. Moseley on her left. Below Judy sat Mr. and Mrs.
Cleve Stuart. Below Mrs. Moseley sat Mr. William Walling
and Mrs. Duncan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman sat on Mr. Walling’s right hand, and Dandy
on his left. Other guests, chiefly the young people of the
colonel’s family, filled all the other seats. Mike sat halfway
up on the right side of the board.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two waiters, in black dress suits, white satin waistcoats
and kid gloves, served the guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea, coffee or chocolate was offered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy took tea—in what a little, fragile eggshell of a
cup! How different from the massive, yellow bowl from
which he used to gulp great draughts of that rare luxury, or
something made up to imitate it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was afraid to touch this chrysalis for fear he should
crush it. He left it on the table before him, and following
Longman’s given rule, watched to see how other people
handled their cups; as a matter of detail, he watched Col.
Moseley, who stood, in his estimation, for the most perfect
gentleman he knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this precaution he avoided the mistake of pouring
his tea into his saucer, which otherwise he would surely
have done; for what on earth else were saucers made for
anyhow?</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently came around the boned turkey and the chicken
salad.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy chose the salad. But where was the knife with
which to shovel the delicious compounds into his capacious
mouth? Clearly the waiter had neglected his duty in providing
a knife, for there was nothing beside his plate but
a silver instrument with four fine prongs. In despair he
looked in the direction of his model, the colonel, and saw
that gentleman eating with the silver thing, holding it in
his right hand. All the others round the table were doing
the same thing!</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Dandy shook his head, saying within himself:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Sure, and I don’t like these newfangled ways; they
ain’t Irish, nor ’Merican, nor they ain’t natural, nuther!
But it’s a baste I am to be finding fault at Ran’s wedding,
so it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then Dandy ate his salad as well as he could with
his unaccustomed instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fest went on, and delicacy after delicacy was served.
Plates were often changed, dishes were changed. Tea, coffee
and chocolate gave place to tokay, champagne and
johanisberg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy, following what he considered a safe rule, but
which was soon proved to be anything else but safe, did as
he saw other people do, and got through the feast very
creditably until at length Col. Moseley arose in his place
and called the attention of the company in a neat little
speech, which he concluded with:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to
propose the health of the bride and groom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Up jumped Dandy to do as other people—notably his
model colonel did, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me, too, ladies and gintlemin! I purpose the good
health of the bride and groom!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Consternation fell for a moment on the company, but the
colonel had suffered more than one “surprise” in the course
of his military life, and he was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir, in the name of our friends,” he said
gravely, bowing to Dandy. “Then, gentlemen, fill up your
glasses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The toast was honored. And no one felt more satisfied
with himself and with all the world than did Dandy Quin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other toasts were offered and equally honored, Dandy
taking a conspicuous part in every one.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was twelve o’clock when the guests sat down to the
table. It was two when they arose and withdrew to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Judy went upstairs to change her light bridal dress
for the heavy green cloth suit that was to defend her from
the wintry winds of the open sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>At her earnest request no one was to go down to the
steamer to see them off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I shall behave badly. I know I shall. I shall
cry. And it is so awful to cry in public!” said Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>All her effects had been packed and sent on the steamer,
except the one little trunk into which her last belongings
were to go, and which was to be put into the carriage with
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>So as soon as she was dressed for the departure—cloth
suit, fur-lined cloak, beaver poke and all—she came down,
into the drawing-room, where all her friends were assembled,
and there she bade them all good-by. She kissed,
embraced and wept over her friends, one after the other;
but when she came to Mrs. Moseley she clung to her as if
she could never leave her, weeping as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last it was that tender lady herself who gently unwound
the girl’s arms from around her neck, and stooping,
whispered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at Ran, dear. See how distressed he is. He must
not see you grieve so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy hastily wiped her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Moseley beckoned Ran, who came forward and received
the girl from the lady’s arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Ran, dear,” sobbed Judy, falling into her dialect,
“don’t ye moind me crying. Sure it’s a cowld-harrted craychur
I’d be not to graive, parting with the loikes av her, a
rale highborn leddy as has ben sich a mother to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My own dear Judy!” whispered Ran. And that was
all he could say.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike had taken leave of all his friends and had gone
on before. But there were two more whom Judy thought
she must bid good-by to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is Misther Longman and Uncle Dandy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are, Misthress Hay!” answered old Dandy
from the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I must bid ye good-by, dear frinds!” said Judy,
holding out her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nivir a bit of it, hinny. Sure we’re all in the same boat!
That is, the same stamer! We go wid ye across the say!
On’v ye’s go in the grand first cabin, and we go in the
second. Our duds went on board this morning, and Mike’s
gone down to the tovvurn to pay our score. And, sure, he’ll
join us on the stamer!” said Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I knew Mike was to go with us, but didn’t know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>you were. I am so glad you are going with us!” exclaimed
Judy, drying her last tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ran was hurrying her into the carriage that was to
take them to the steamer. When he had placed her in her
seat he returned to speak to the two men.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since you are going in the same ship, ride down with
us. There are two vacant seats in our carriage,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t think of such a thing!” exclaimed Longman,
laughing. “What! intrude on a bride and groom! We appreciate
your magnanimity and thank you mightily, but we
couldn’t think of it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And though Ran urged his invitation, Longman steadily
refused it, much to Dandy’s disgust, who would willingly
have enjoyed the luxury of a ride in that elegant clarence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will go down in the horse cars and get there before
you. You’ll find us on deck when you arrive. Come,
Dandy!” said Longman, and raising his felt wide awake, he
walked away, carrying off his unwilling little old friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran entered the carriage and gave the order to the coachman.
And they started for the steamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>A half-hour’s drive brought them to the crowded pier,
and five minutes’ struggle through the confusion transferred
them to the deck of the <em>Boadicea</em>, where they found Will
Walling, Mike, Longman, and Dandy waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No more partings here, dear Judy. Here are meetings!”
said Ran with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later the <em>Boadicea</em> sailed.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that same moment Mrs. Duncan, taking leave of Mrs.
Walling, repeated her words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! won’t there be a circus when Mr. and Mrs. Randolph
Hay confront Gentleman Geff and Miss Leegh at
Haymore! How I would like to be there!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='large'>DARKEST BEFORE DAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Stuart took his wife home from the wedding breakfast.
It was four o’clock, and the wintry sun was low on the
western horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Mrs. Pole had a good fire burning in the little grate when
they entered the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See, Poley! I have brought you a piece of the wedding
cake to dream on, you know!” said Palma, offering a pretty
little box done up in silver paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, my dear! My dreaming days are long past! long
past!” sighed the old woman, as, nevertheless, she took the
box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a prosaic old fogy you are, Poley, to be sure. For
that matter all our dreaming days are over after we are
married, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, honey, until we begin to dream for our children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma blushed and sank into sudden silence. She was
beginning to dream sweet dreams of motherhood, but that
was her own precious secret, she imagined, not suspecting
that Mrs. Pole knew as much about it as she did herself, and
perhaps more. To cover her confusion she laughed and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Poley, if you do not care to dream on the cake
yourself you can give it to some young friends of yours, to
one of your many cousins or nieces; they will be glad to
have it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she threw off her turban and her wraps, drew off
her gloves and sank into an easy-chair before the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, it is good to be quiet at home, is it not, Cleve?
I love this little snuggery of ours. We can live very happily
here until next May, and then flit to the woods and
mountains again. I think I like our simple way of life.
Cleve, quite as well, if not better, than if you spent all
the revenues of your Mississippi plantation in living in the
grand style of some of our friends. What do you think,
Cleve?” she inquired, stretching out her pretty feet to the
grateful warmth of the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not answer in words—he could not; he laid his
hand tenderly on her curly, black hair and turned slowly
away and went out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma received the caress as a full assent to all that she
had said, and smiled to herself as she gazed into the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve Stuart went downstairs and out upon the sidewalk,
and paced up and down before the house. This was his
nightly promenade ground, where he came to smoke his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>cigar. But this evening he had no cigar, nor even the
wherewithal to get one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, it had come to this—Cleve Stuart was absolutely
penniless. He had paid out his last dime on the horse cars
that brought himself and his wife from the wedding breakfast.
This was Saturday, the second of December. On
Monday, the fourth, their month’s rent would be due, and
there was not a penny to meet it.</p>

<p class='c009'>What should he do?</p>

<p class='c009'>If all his remaining earthly possessions were pawned they
would not bring money enough to meet the demand of their
landlord.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor could he hope for any forbearance from that quarter.
The terms of the contract were strict, and amounted, in
brief, to this: “Pay or go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor could he bring himself to the shame, not to say the
dishonesty, of trying to borrow money which he could foresee
no way of paying.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the pass to which his marriage with Palma had
brought him! Did he regret his marriage?</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” he said to himself, “though I proposed to her, first
of all, under the diabolical influence of the beautiful fiend
who had me in her power, and for mercenary purposes that
were to serve us, the two conspirators, yet for one redeeming
event I do thank Providence—and that is that I discovered
Palma to be penniless as well as invalided before I
married her. Then I kept faith with her; I married her; I
saved her precious life, and I have grown to know her and
to love her above all things on earth. And to whatever
straits I may be reduced, and however much I may suffer,
I will, so far as possible, shield my beloved one from knowing
them or sharing them. But in the meantime what in
the name of Heaven am I to do? And what is to become
of her? Men in such straits as mine have been driven, are
daily driven, to commit suicide. We read such cases in
almost every paper, and often with the concluding comment:
‘No motive could be discovered for the desperate
deed.’ I suppose, now, if I were to be so lost to a sense of
justice as to end my trouble with a shot to-night, it would
be said to-morrow: ‘He had just come from a wedding
breakfast, where he appeared among the happiest of the
guests. No motive can be surmised for his desperate deed.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>As if men paraded their perplexities to all and sundry, in
season and out of season, and wore their motives and intentions
pinned on their sleeves—especially such motives and
intentions. Pah! nothing could drive me to such a deed.
I must live and brave my fate, trusting in Heaven, doing
my duty! But all the same, sweet little Palma, if it were
Heaven’s will, I think it would be well if you and I should
fall asleep to-night and never awake again in this world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So deep, so painful, so absorbing was his reverie that he
did not perceive the approach of the postman, who ran
against him in the dark, begged his pardon and passed on
until he reached the main entrance of the apartment house,
went in, came out, and hurried on again out of sight up
the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart had scarcely noticed him, beyond muttering, “Not
at all,” when the other had said, “Beg pardon, sir.” And
now he thought no more of the incident, but continued his
walk for an hour, as if by wearying his body he might
relieve his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently, thinking that this was their dinner hour,
though he had little appetite for dinner just now, he turned
and entered the hall. He did not ring up the elevator, but
he walked heavily up the five flights of stairs. It was a
mental relief to fatigue himself to faintness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He entered the little parlor and found not dinner, but
the tea table spread.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma was sitting behind the urn and waiting for him.
The fire was very bright, the parlor very snug, and the little
wife very happy. If this could only continue!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought, after a wedding feast at two o’clock, that tea
would be better than dinner at six. So I told Poley. Do
you mind, Cleve?” inquired Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear; indeed, I prefer tea; it will be more refreshing,”
he replied, trying to overcome the heaviness of his
soul so that it should not appear in his look or tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Poley has made some of her delicious, light, puffy
muffins. I never saw any so nice anywhere as she can make.
I tell you, Cleve, dear, if our riches should suddenly ‘take
unto themselves wings and fly away,’ Poley and I would
open a bake shop with a specialty of these tea muffins.
Poley should make them. I would stand behind the counter
and sell them and you should keep the accounts, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>should all three make our fortunes and divide the profits,”
said Palma as she poured out the delicate Japan tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart smiled as he took a cup from her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I forgot to tell you. There’s a letter for you! It
came while you were out. I put it on the corner of the
mantelpiece. Will you look at it now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear; I know what it is. It is only the bill for the
month’s rent. The landlord always sends it on the third of
the month, and as the third comes on Sunday this time, he
has sent it on Saturday, a day earlier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try a muffin, Cleve. You don’t know how nice they
are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took one to please her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she chatted on about the wedding they had just
attended, and the young pair who had just sailed for
Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are so anxious that we shall go and visit them at
Haymore as soon as they shall be settled there, Cleve. And,
indeed, I did promise to use all my influence with you to
persuade you to take me over next summer. Why, Cleve, it
would be ever so much pleasanter than to go to Lull’s again,
even! And yet I used to think Lull’s was just Paradise!
What do you think, Cleve?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think, my dear one, that it would be very delightful
to spend the summer with our friends at Haymore. As
much as I have traveled, I have never been in Yorkshire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you think we may go?” eagerly demanded Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Providence permitting, yes, my dear,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>She perceived no evasion in this answer. Indeed, the
phrase was her own habitual formula whenever she fully
intended to do any certain thing, “Providence permitting.”
She took his words for consent and answered gleefully:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be something to look forward to during the
winter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart smiled. Ah! how hard to keep up that cheerful
countenance and light tone when his heart was so heavy
and his mind so dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>They lingered long at the tea table, because Palma was
full of life and of the enjoyment of all life’s blessings, in
possession and in anticipation.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they arose at last and the table was cleared of the
tea service, and the books and magazines replaced on it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Palma took her workbasket and Cleve a book, and she
sewed at mending gloves, he read aloud “The Annals of a
Quiet Neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The letter on the mantelpiece, confidently believed to be
the rent bill, was not looked at, or even thought of. There
it lay, and was fated to lay, until Monday morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young pair retired at their usual hour; but only
Palma slept. The vulture of anxiety, gnawing at his heart,
kept Stuart wide awake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sunday dawned clear, bright and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young couple arose and breakfasted and went to
church.</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked all the way, not because Cleve had not a
dime to pay car fare—though he had not—but because
Palma never wished to tax the horses on the Sabbath day
except in cases of absolute necessity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because,” she urged, “the merciful command of the
Lord provides for the rest of the beast as well as of the man,
and these horses work hard enough all the week to rest on
Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Stuart had always yielded to her scruples in this
respect.</p>

<p class='c009'>The organ was pealing forth a fine voluntary when they
entered the church and took their seats. The music ceased
and the service began. Palma entered into it with all the
loving devotion of her heart and soul. Cleve could not concentrate
his thoughts on worship, though he tried to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a little while, in due course, the first hymn was
given out, and the first line fell like a trumpet blast, calling
the Christian soul to hope and courage:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Give to the winds thy fears!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hope and be undismayed!</div>
      <div class='line'>God hears thy sighs and sees thy tears,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>God shall lift up thy head.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The words thrilled him, aroused him; all the black shadows
of grief, shame, despair and desperation, which had
bowed and cowed his spirit with the sense of helplessness
and humiliation, rolled away as before a rising sun. It
seemed wonderful, miraculous, a memory of divine intervention
that never left him in all his after life. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>always worshiped God as the supreme ruler of the universe;
but never had known Him as the Heavenly Father. But
from this hour he knew, or rather he felt, that “the God of
the universe, the God of the race, was the God of the individual
man,” the giver of life, the giver of heaven, the giver
of the daily bread as well.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sermon which followed was from the text: “Are not
two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your Father.... Fear
not, therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The sermon that followed was almost worthy of the
text, not quite, for no man’s nor angel’s words can add to
the Word of the Lord; but it was faithfully, lovingly and
practically applied, and it did good service.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the worship Stuart, as well as Palma, came
out into the sunlight refreshed and comforted.</p>

<p class='c009'>That morning Stuart, in his dark mood, had shrunk from
the exertion of going to church. What would be the use?
he had thought in his secret heart; and he had tried to
excuse himself to Palma, but she, from a feeling of duty,
had persuaded him to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now as they walked uptown through the sunny air he
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad we went to church to-day, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I. We got our daily bread, our heavenly manna
there, did we not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached home and found their pleasant little parlor
aglow with the bright fire in the grate, and inviting with
the neatly spread table and the simple midday meal of the
Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole had also been to church at a much nearer point,
and had got home before them in good time to lay the cloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dinner over, they spent the afternoon in reading.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had an early tea, and then went out to church for
the evening service, walking there and back again. They
reached home after ten o’clock, for the way was long. They
were revived in spirit and wholesomely fatigued in body, so
that they soon retired to rest and slept well. Even Stuart
slept, though he believed that this night ended their last
day in their pretty home, and that the next morning would
send them adrift, bereft of all their effects, except the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>clothes they wore, and Heaven only knew whither! But—they
would be in their Father’s world! No one could turn
them out of that. So they slept in peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have been particular in describing these last two days
of Stuart’s and Palma’s experience, for they were ever after
memorable in their lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday morning they arose early, as usual. It had
been Stuart’s daily custom to go out after breakfast in
search of employment. He had continued this under all
discouragements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet this morning he stayed at home to see the landlord’s
collector, who always arrived the day after the bill had come
by mail. As the bill had arrived on Saturday, and the collector
could not come on Sunday, he would certainly put in
an appearance on Monday, and Palma must not be left
alone to receive him—under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma took her knitting—a pair of mittens for Mrs. Pole—and
sat down to work near the window, from which she
could look below upon the housetops and above to the glorious
December sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart took a book and threw himself into a rocking-chair
by the table, but he did not read. He was waiting—for
what? He did not know.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door opened and “the boy” came in, silently laid a
letter on the table, and went out again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart took it up and opened it. Palma looked up from
her work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—this is the rent bill. I thought it came Saturday.
Where is that letter that came?” Stuart inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the corner of the mantelpiece. I’ll get it for you,”
said Palma; and she arose and handed him the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took it and gazed at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know the handwriting at all,” he said meditatively,
“and it is postmarked ‘Wolfswalk, West Virginia.’
I should think it was intended for some one else, if my
name was not such an uncommon one, and certainly there is
no one else in this house that bears it.” And he turned it
over and over and scrutinized it after the strange manner of
people who receive a mysterious letter and play with their
own curiosity by delaying to open it. At length he broke
the envelope and unfolded the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>First of all he turned to the signature, which was at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>bottom of the fourth page, so that he did not happen to
open the sheet and find what lay between the leaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘John Cleve!’” he exclaimed. “Why, dear Palma, this
is from my old bachelor great-uncle, who, I thought, had
been gathered to his fathers ages ago. He must be at least
eighty years old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cleve, read it to me! I never knew you had an
uncle,” said Palma, dropping her work and coming and
leaning over the back of his chair so that she could look at
the open letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve read as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Wolfswalk, West Virginia</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>“November 25, 186—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear Grand-nephew</span>: You will be surprised to
get a letter from me, of whom you can have but little
memory, as you have not seen me since you were a babe of
three years old, when your dear mother—my dear and only
niece—brought you to my house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since her lamented death, in Mississippi, I had completely
lost sight of you, thinking of you as in the hands of
competent guardians during your minority, and of leading
a prosperous life as an active planter on your estate since
your majority. I thought of writing to you, but neglected
to do so. How families do get separated in this world, to
be sure, neglecting each other, forgetting each other, like
aliens!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Several circumstances have occurred to bring you
forcibly to my mind of late. First, the fact that my two
grand-nephews, Frank and James, sole descendants of my
only nephew, Charles, fell on the field of Cold Harbor,
fighting for their native State. They died unmarried.
This leaves you my sole heir.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As soon as I learned this fact I wrote to you in Mississippi,
but failed to get a letter from you. I wrote to the
postmaster of your post office there, and learned from him
that you had been an absentee from home for many years.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I thought of advertising for you, but so hated the
plan that I delayed putting it in execution.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At length chance favored me and gave the information I
desired. A neighbor of mine went off on a business trip and
was in Washington City last week, and met there a friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of yours—a Mr. Walling, of New York. By the merest
accident your name came up—neither of the gentlemen
knowing of how much importance it was to me—and Fairfax
heard that you were in New York City, and, in fact,
much about you which it is not necessary to repeat here, but
all of which he told me. Therefore, I write you this letter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, since you are not bound down to your Mississippi
plantation, and since you are my sole heir, and I am
old and feeble, and cannot last long, I ask you to be a
good boy, and a dutiful nephew, and to come and bring your
wife and live with me on the farm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have not suffered, as so many have, by the war. It
did not sweep over my land, but gave it a rather wide berth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My negroes have remained with me at fair wages, but
whether they do fair work is something else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have an overseer to look after the negroes, but, my boy,
I require some one to look after the overseer. Will you
come?</p>

<p class='c013'>“As breaking up and traveling is always expensive, and
as I do not know your financial condition, I inclose a check
for five hundred dollars, merely as an advance to my heir.
Give my love to your wife. Let me hear from you as soon
as possible, and believe me, my dear Cleve, now and ever,
your affectionate grand-uncle,</p>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>John Cleve</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Thank God!” fervently ejaculated Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where is the check?” curiously inquired Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart opened the leaves of the letter again, then his face
fell and he murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My uncle must have forgotten to put it in!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Palma, “here it is!” And she picked it up
from the carpet, to which it had slipped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank God!” said Stuart again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I am glad, very glad, that you have heard from
your uncle. But you, Cleve! I have never in all my life
seen you so strongly moved. What is it all about?” exclaimed
Palma, amazed at his extreme agitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My darling, when this providential letter came we were
on the brink of ruin!” he answered, telling her the truth
at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Ruin!’ You! Cleve Stuart!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Yes, my beloved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But your vast wealth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A fond imagination of yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your rich Mississippi plantation?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A blasted wilderness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cleve! Cleve! How have we lived?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the gradual disposal of all my useless effects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cleve! Cleve!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The last dime was spent on Saturday, dear, and this
morning I looked for nothing else but a distrain for rent
and ejection from these premises.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you never told me! You never told me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should I have distressed you, dear one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I could have worked, Cleve. But I didn’t know!
I didn’t know! I thought you were rich. And I thought,
sometimes, that you were too prudent, too saving, especially
when you did not get a dress coat to go to Ran’s wedding.
And all the time you were poor, and struggling on the very
brink of ruin! Oh, Cleve!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, dear heart, we are ready for the landlord,
or for any other demand. Tell me, darling, shall you like
to go to this mountain farmhouse in West Virginia, and
keep house for the old man, and be mistress, doctress,
teacher and everything, to his horde of darkies?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes—a thousand times, yes! I shall
be delighted, Cleve!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then. As it all depended upon you, I will
answer the old man’s letter and accept his offer; then go out
and change this check.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no; first of all, dear Cleve,” said Palma, gravely,
“let us kneel and return thanks to our Heavenly Father
that we are saved.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='large'>SAFE AT HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We left Jennie Montgomery sleeping in her mother’s
arms, with her babe safe beside them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie would have talked all night till broad daylight;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>but her mother, knowing how tired the young traveler must
be, discouraged all conversation by pretending to be sleepy,
by replying only in monosyllables, or even answering at
random, until at length the talker herself gave up in despair,
grew tired, then stupid, and then fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>The consequence of her exhausted strength and her long
vigil was that she slept long and deeply and late into the
next morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>When at last she awoke she found herself alone in the
room, with the morning sunlight stealing through the slats
of the window shutters, and gilding bright lines on the
white window curtains and on the light gray ground of the
carpet and the light gray color of the walls. She saw all
this through the festooned white curtains at the foot of her
bed. She raised herself up, and then she saw something
through the same opening—a bright little coal fire burning
in the grate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her mother was gone and her baby was gone. Evidently
Jennie had slept so soundly that she had not heard their
uprising and departure, and she had continued to sleep on
until she knew not what hour of the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>She thought she would get up and dress herself quietly
before any one should discover that she was awake.</p>

<p class='c009'>She slipped out of bed, and the first thing that she saw
was her large sea trunk, that had been packed with undiscovered
treasure of clothing by the benevolent women
who had taken such a warm interest in her welfare, and who
had given her an outfit as well as a first-class passage home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The key of her trunk was in her <i><span lang="fr">portemonnaie</span></i>, in the
pocket of her traveling dress. She got it out, unstrapped
and unlocked the treasure chest, and lifted the lid.</p>

<p class='c009'>But just then she heard the voice of her baby crowing
loudly in response to another cooing voice that she recognized
as her mother’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were having a grand circus together in the parlor,
that young grandmother and the baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie snatched up the first garment fitting to wear from
the top of the trunk, and then dropped the lid and hastily
washed and dressed herself, putting on a pretty blue cashmere
princess wrapper, trimmed with blue satin ribbons.
Then, while still buttoning up, she hastily opened the dividing
door and entered the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Her mother was there, sitting in a low rocker, holding
the baby across her lap. Beside her, on the hob of the grate,
stood the bowl of “infant food” from which she had been
feeding the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one else in the room, nor did there need to
be to make it very lively there, for the baby was crowing
with all the strength of her lungs, while laughing up in the
pretty, smiling face, with the cooing voice, bending over
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, mamma, darling! why didn’t you wake me?” exclaimed
Jennie, coming up before Mrs. Campbell perceived
her presence in the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Jennie! Up and dressed, my pet? Why didn’t
you ring for some one to help you?” inquired the mother
in her turn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t answered my question yet, and told me why
you did not wake me when you got up and dressed baby,”
said Jennie as she stooped and kissed her mother and the
child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was so well satisfied to see you sleeping off your fatigue
that I would not have disturbed you for a great deal,” said
Mrs. Campbell, returning her daughter’s caress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, the reason I didn’t ring for any one was because
I didn’t want any one. And when I heard you and
baby in such earnest conversation, I hurried with my dressing
and came in. I thought baby would be hungry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was hungry; but I sent to the chemist and got this
‘infant food’ for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! she never was fed with that before!” exclaimed
Jennie, in some doubt of its good effects.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be afraid, my dear. It is used in all the royal
nurseries. See, the royal arms are on the label,” said the
lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, mamma, darling, if you give it, it is all right.
I think your judgment quite as good as that of all the royal
family put together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut! tut! my pet! Your visit to America must have
turned you into a republican. But what a lovely wrapper
you have got on, Jennie!” she said, perhaps to turn the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it not? And I have got another one just like it in
mauve, which has never been on my back, and which you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>must have, dear mamma. Those angel women in New York
have given me that huge trunk full of beautiful clothing,
and I shall never wear one-half of it out, but my greatest
pleasure in it will be to divide it with you, my dear, darling,
beautiful mamma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jennie!” was all the curate’s wife found to say to
that, for she did not mean to take any of her daughter’s
pretty clothes, if she could help it, nor did she want to vex
the girl by refusing them just then.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is papa?” inquired Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone out to make some sick calls; he will be home by
noon. But here I am chatting away and forgetting that you
have had no breakfast. We breakfasted two hours ago!”
laughed Mrs. Campbell as she put her hand out to the bell
rope and rang.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elspeth Longman came in, smiled and nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, ma’am,” to Jennie, and then went to
work to lay the cloth for her breakfast. It was soon spread
upon the table—good coffee, rich cream, muffins, fresh
butter, grilled ham and poached eggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Campbell gave the baby to Elspeth and sat down to
pour out the coffee for her prodigal daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, mamma! You remember our old feeling, yours and
mine, that a draught poured out by beloved hands has the
power of life-giving to the spirit as well as to the body,”
said Jennie as she received the cup from her mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the same may be said of work gifts, my dear.
Your little Shetland veil that you knit for me years ago,
always seemed full as it could hold of your dear love, and
its touch on my face like your caress,” replied Mrs. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>While they sat at table Elspeth Longman stood at one of
the windows with the baby in her arms, tapping on the
panes to make the child look out on the blue sky and the
evergreen trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall stop calling baby ‘Baby’ now, mamma. She is
going to be named after you—Esther. It is too grown up
a name to call a little baby in common. And we can’t call
her Hetty, because that is your pet name. Now what shall
we call her for short?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Essy,” replied the young grandmother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Essy, then, it shall be. Mind, Mrs. Longman. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>baby is to the christened Esther, after mamma, and we are
to call her Essy for short.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, ma’am; it is a pretty name,” said the woman
at the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we will have her christened on Sunday, mamma.
We must wait for Sunday, because I remember papa’s preference
for christening babies on Sunday, unless there should
be some pressing necessity to perform the ceremony on a
week day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s grandpa!” exclaimed Elspeth to the baby, tapping
on the window. And the next instant, the Rev. James
Campbell—otherwise familiarly and affectionately in his
own family called “Jimmy”—entered the house and walked
into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He kissed his daughter good-morning, and then took his
stand on the rug, with his back to the fire, looking so grave
that his wife grew anxious, but forbore to question him in
the presence of their newly returned daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And perhaps, after all,” she reflected, “it is nothing
very personal. He may have just returned from the deathbed
of a parishioner. Such scenes always affect him, more
for the sake of those left behind than for the departed, for
he has too much faith to fret after the freed soul.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Mrs. Campbell was turning these thoughts over in
her mind, and Mr. Campbell was standing in silence on the
rug, Jennie finished her breakfast and arose and took her
crowing baby from the arms of Elspeth, that the latter
might clear off the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>When this was done, and the woman had left the room,
and Jennie had put her baby to sleep in the pretty berceaunette
that had been provided by her mother that very
morning, and the father, mother and daughter were seated
around the fire, both these women with needlework in their
hands, the curate said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear, if you will, you may give us the explanation
you promised. Hetty!” he said, suddenly turning to
his wife, “did she tell you anything last night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a word. I would not let her talk. I made her go
to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was right. Well, we know from her letter that
she, daughter of a minister of the church of England,
though a very humble one, and the wife of an ex-officer in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>her majesty’s service, though a most unworthy one—that
she, a lady by birth and by marriage, was brought to such
extremity as to be confined in the pauper ward of a public
hospital, and to depend on private charity for her outfit and
passage home to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks be to the Lord that we have her and her child
safe and sound in mind and body, however they came to
us!” fervently exclaimed Hetty Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say we know all this from our child’s letter. But we
do not know why all this should have happened in this way;
nor why she never mentioned her husband’s name in her
letter; nor why she comes to us with her child alone; nor
why, when I asked her for an explanation, she replied to
me that the kindest act he ever did for her was—to leave
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my Jennie! Oh, my dear Jennie!” exclaimed
Hetty in a tone of pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, mamma; it is true. The kindest thing he ever did
for me was to leave me. I am not heartbroken over it. I
have nothing, not the least thing, to reproach myself with
in all my conduct toward him. Mamma, when I made
Capt. Kightly Montgomery’s acquaintance I</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Foregathered wi’ the de’il.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jennie—my daughter!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is hard fact, mamma, as you will know when you
have heard the story I am going to tell you. Is there any
danger of any one coming in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear. There is no one in the house besides ourselves
except Elspeth, and as this is baking day she is very
busy in the kitchen, and will not come in here unless she
should be called,” said Hetty. Nevertheless, she got up and
turned the keys in both doors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, my dear,” she said as she resumed her seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a long story, and a painful one; yet, for every reason,
I feel that I must tell you the whole of it without
reservation, because I shall have to seek your counsel and
be guided by it as to my future course,” said Jennie, turning
to her father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; tell every word you know,” replied Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Jennie told the whole horrible story—of her secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>marriage—of which her parents had heard before—of the
many devices by which her husband had kept her away
from her parents, even after they had received her penitent
letter, and forgiven her, and invited her and her bridegroom
to visit them; of their wanderings through Europe, stopping
at the great gambling centers; of his abandonment of her;
or her pursuit of him over land and sea; of their meeting at
night in the streets of New York, just when he was on the
eve of marriage with another woman; of his fright at her
appearance, his instant repudiation of her, and their bitter
altercation, which ended in his stabbing her and leaving her
for dead on the sidewalk of the deserted street,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In the dead waste and middle of the night.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At this point of the story Mrs. Campbell screamed and
flung her hands up to her eyes as if to shut out the horrible
vision her imagination had conjured up from the words of
Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then there followed a pause in the narrative until Hetty
had recovered herself. Meanwhile the curate sat in grim
silence, like a man who resolves but does not mean to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Jennie who broke the spell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is the very worst, mamma. I have nothing to tell
worse than this—no, nor half as bad—and you see that it
did not kill me. And now what I have to tell you is mostly
a pleasant experience; for when I recovered consciousness,
which was after many hours, I found myself on a nice, white
bed in a pleasant room, with the sweetest, kindest woman’s
face, like an angel’s face, bending over me, and my new-born
baby lying beside me. Yes; my wound had been in the
flesh of my left breast, shocking me into a swoon, but not
fatal—as he had supposed it to be—and not even dangerous.
Under some anæsthetic—I suppose, though I do not know—my
wound had been dressed, and my baby born, and I
awoke in such a heaven of peace and good will, with my
precious baby by my side, and with angels of mercy all
about me, that, mamma, every vestige of anger against my
husband for all his wrongs to me vanished from my bosom;
although there remained a shrinking from the thought of
ever meeting him again, and a horror of him that I feel can
never be overcome in this life. As soon as I was well enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to bear the ordeal I was questioned as to my assailant; but
I would not tell who he was. The police searched my room
on Vevay Street, and found his miniature; but it happened
to be the one which had been taken when he was in the
army, in his regimental uniform, and with his military
mustache, and it bore his monogram, K. M. They brought
it to me, but I would have nothing to say to it; nor was it
available to trace Montgomery, for he now wore a citizen’s
dress, had grown a full, long beard, and he bore another
name—a name supported by documentary and direct evidence—a
name which it will surprise you to hear—but let
that pass for the present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not tell us now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait, mamma, dear. I am following the narrative as
the facts came to my knowledge. The miniature was photographed
and distributed to aid in the identification and
arrest of the suspected party. It did not lead to Montgomery’s
arrest, but to that of an unlucky gentleman who
bore some resemblance to the photograph, especially in the
matter of the martial mustache. This hapless person was
brought before me for identification. The likeness struck
even me at first, and startled me into a compromising exclamation;
but a second glance assured me that I had never
seen the man before in my life; and I told them so. They
did not believe me. And afterward it took the evidence of
several substantial citizens to convince the magistrate before
whom he was brought that the accused man was quite a distinct
individual from Capt. Kightly Montgomery, my supposed
assailant. I say my supposed assailant, dear mamma;
for they could not know him for such, since I would not
give him up to justice; for I wish him no harm, though I
never want to see him in this world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” breathed Hetty with all a mother’s intense
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you in my letter of the great goodness of those
angel women in New York to me, and how, as soon as I
was able to leave the hospital, one of them, dear Mrs. Duncan,
took me home to her own house, where she cared for
me and my baby as—as you do, sweet mamma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless them!” exclaimed Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I stayed with her while the ladies were preparing my
outfit, and until I took passage on the <em>Scorpio</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“And you saw no more of that——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The conscientious minister hesitated at a word that any
other man, under the circumstances, would have pronounced
with vim.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie understood him, and answered promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear papa. I saw no more of him until I was eight
days out at sea. Then we came face to face on deck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Face to face on deck!’” exclaimed Hetty in dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Face to face on deck!’ Then he was actually coming
over on the same ship with yourself?” said the curate, losing
much of his self-control.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa. Yes, mamma. He was coming over on the
same ship with myself. Coming over under his new name,
with his new, deceived bride. They had been married with
the greatest <i><span lang="fr">éclat</span></i> in one of the most wealthy and fashionable
houses in New York. And they were on their wedding
tour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Jennie gave a detailed account of the meeting between
the recreant husband and the wronged wife on board
the <em>Scorpio</em>. She described his fright, awe, horror on meeting
one whom he believed to be in a pauper’s grave in potter’s
field, with the stigma of suicide on her name, and then
his slow acceptance of the fact that it was herself in the
body, and not an optical illusion created by <i><span lang="la">delirium tremens</span></i>,
that was there before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had not dreamed of meeting him there, or anywhere
else on earth,” said Jennie; “but when I saw him before
me, so unexpectedly, I was calmer than he was. I bade him
leave me and avoid me, and told him that I should not
trouble him while we were, unfortunately, on the ship together,
but that I should tell you my whole story and take
your advice as to my future course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did wisely so far,” said the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I told him you were to meet me at Liverpool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He had taken tickets for Liverpool, but he got off, with
his party, at Queenstown.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” breathed the curate, “that was prudently done.
But now, my child, tell me the alias under which this man
is now traveling, and which you said would surprise us very
much?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear papa, first of all, will you please to tell me how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>much you learned of Kightly Montgomery’s true history
when you undertook to investigate the antecedents of the
young officer who had run off with your daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my dear. There was no mystery about him. I
went to the colonel of his regiment, and learned that he
was the son of the late General the Honorable Arthur Montgomery,
who was so distinguished in the Indian war, the
grandson of the late and the nephew of the present Earl of
Engelmeed, and a disgrace to his ancestry and relatives;
and that he had held a commission in the—Regiment of
Foot, but had been court-martialed and dismissed the service
for ‘conduct unworthy of an officer and a gentleman.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you are sure that he is really Kightly Montgomery—that
that is his real name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As sure as that James Campbell is my own,” said the
curate. “And now, will you tell me what name he passed
under in America, and why he dropped his own?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, papa; the name under which he passed in New
York; the name under which he claims the richest estate in
Yorkshire; the name under which he married Miss Lamia
Leegh, of New York; the name under which he sailed in
the <em>Scorpio</em> for Liverpool, is——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes? Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Randolph Hay, of Haymore!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Heaven, Jennie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Lord, Jennie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>These exclamations burst simultaneously from the lips of
Jimmy and Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, mamma! Yes, papa! It is true as truth. Your
landlord and patron, the new Squire of Haymore, for whose
home-coming with his bride all these gorgeous preparations
have been made, is no other than my husband, your son-in-law,
ex-captain of Foot, Kightly Montgomery, who metaphorically
fled from before your face by landing at Queenstown,
to avoid meeting you at Liverpool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Hetty! Hetty!” said the curate, appealing to his
wife, “what is this world coming to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To judgment one of these days, Jimmy, according to
your own preaching! ‘Reck your own read,’ Jimmy. And
take comfort, as I do, that whatever has been, or is, or is to
be, we have our darling daughter and her babe safe at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>home!” paid Hetty, closing her arm around Jennie’s waist
and squeezing her fondly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what a complication! The scoundrel—Heaven
forgive me, the word slipped out!—the man slunk off the
steamer at Queenstown for fear of meeting me at Liverpool,
and now he is walking unaware into my very arms!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I don’t believe that your arms will fold him in a
very fond embrace!” exclaimed Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they had but the strength I fear it would be in the
grizzly bear’s hug, or the boa constrictor’s crush!” exclaimed
the curate, gasping.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the mad audacity of his coming here, where you
are! I don’t understand it,” said Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, he does not dream that I am here! How
should he? He thinks that we are all at Medge, on the
south coast, with the length of England between us and
Haymore!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So! I forgot that! What shall you do, Jimmy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing at present; but wait for his coming; then I
will confront him and expose him to the lady he has deceived
and feloniously married. Meanwhile, Hetty and
Jennie, my dears, breathe not a word of this secret to any
one, whoever he or she may be. The effrontery of the man
in calling himself Randolph Hay, and claiming the Haymore
estates, is nothing less than insanity! And the credulity
of lawyers in allowing his claim is past belief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but, my dear father, he had piles and piles of documents,
and no end of direct testimony besides! I heard all
about Mr. Randolph Hay’s appearance and claim to the
Haymore estates, and his engagement to Miss Leegh from
Mrs. Duncan, before I ever discovered that the claimant
and bridegroom-elect were identical with my own recreant
husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forged or stolen documents, Jennie. And suborned and
perjured witnesses! That is the story of his claim, Jennie.
But breathe not a word to any one of this affair! Let the
tenants and the villagers go on with their preparations for
a grand fête. Let Capt. Kightly Montgomery and his bride
come on in triumph to enjoy it! The higher the flight the
heavier the fall for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the poor lady! She was one of those who helped
me, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“I am sorry for her! But, even for her sake, the man
should be exposed and punished. She must not live with
him in sin!” said the curate. Then, after a pause, “I cannot
comprehend how he dares to come to England! One
would think that he would be afraid of being recognized. It
is true that he believes this family to be on the south coast.
True, also, that he knows the regiment to which he lately
belonged to be in India, so that there is no danger of his
meeting with any of his late fellow officers, but still it is
always possible that he may be recognized and exposed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa, you do not know what a change the full beard,
and a difference in the parting of his hair, has made in
him,” said Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, besides, did we not hear that the new squire does
not intend to reside in England for some years to come?
Did not some one say that he was only coming here to make
a sort of triumphal entry upon his paternal land, and then,
after liberally treating all his tenants and the villagers, he
was to leave on extended travels?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! yes! I believe we did hear something of the
sort. I suppose the fellow thinks he can safely come here
with his bride to gratify his pride and vanity, by exhibiting
her and himself in a triumphal entry, after the manner of
royal personages! I dare say he thinks himself secure in
doing that. But he does not know the Nemesis that is waiting
for him! He does not dream that he will exchange triumph
for shame, luxury for torture, and Haymore Hall and
fox-hunting for Portsmouth Isle and penal servitude!” exclaimed
the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then rising, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must go and write my sermon. And this has given me
some new ideas for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when he left the room Hetty and Jennie both knew
that the sermon in question would be likely to deal more
with the terrors of the law than with the mercies of the
Lord.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='large'>COMING EVENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The autumn days passed calmly at the parsonage of Haymore.
The curate had his own care, but he kept it to himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>On that morning succeeding Jennie’s arrival, when
Hetty had observed traces of unusual disturbance on the
brow of her Jimmy and had ascribed it to the effect of
some distressing deathbed scene of some parishioner
and therefore had forborne to question him, the cause of the
curate’s uneasiness was just this: He had, by that morning’s
mail, received a letter from his rector at Cannes,
speaking hopelessly of his own illness and predicting an
early and fatal issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>James Campbell would not disturb his wife and daughter
with this news, though it troubled him deeply and for more
reasons than one.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place, he felt a warm affection for the venerable
rector who had been his father’s classmate at Oxford,
and who had remembered him when he could do him a
service and put him into his present position.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the second place, should the rector die soon, his successor
would be appointed by the Squire of Haymore and
would naturally dismiss him, James Campbell, from his
curacy. And he and his family would have to go forth in
the world, homeless, moneyless and almost friendless, in
midwinter. What prospect lay before the three but destitution
and indebtedness—practically, first, to go into the
cheapest lodgings they could find; then to go into debt for
their daily food as long as he might be able to get credit.</p>

<p class='c009'>And after that—what?</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not know.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, he would try to get work again—another curacy,
or a tutorship, or a secretaryship. But Jimmy knew
by all his past experience and observation how difficult, how
almost impossible it was for a man in his position, once out
of employment, ever to get in again. If he could only know
who was to be the successor of his dying rector, he might,
at a proper time, try to gain his favor to be made his curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well—he thought—“while he preacheth to others he
must not himself be a castaway.” As Hetty had told him,
he must “reck his own read.” He must do the best he could
and leave the result to divine Providence. If he could only
hold his present position. What a commodious house he had
for his dear ones! What an affluent garden! What a
spacious glebe! What a lovely home, taken altogether!
What a paradisal one for his family! If he could only retain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>it by any amount of work—by doing double duty, tenfold
duty in the parish! He would not shrink from any
labor, any hardship, to retain this refuge for his beloved
ones, he thought. Then his conscience reproached him—he
was thinking too much of his own, too little of his parish;
and besides, the idea of remaining in this sweet home was
but a dream, for if even the successor of his dying rector
should favor him so far as to retain him in the curacy, he
could not continue to reside in the rectory—where, of
course, the new rector would take up his abode—but would
have to find a small house in the village suitable to his small
salary as a curate. But even this last favor was highly improbable.
The new rector would have some young clerical
friend whom he would take as his curate. They always did,
he remembered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there much sickness or suffering in the parish, Jimmy?” Hetty
asked one day when they happened to be alone
in the parlor together, Jennie being in her bedroom with
her baby, and Elspeth in the kitchen over her cooking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sickness? Why, no! Why do you ask?” inquired the
curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there any distress, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no! They are all unusually well just now, and
very hilarious over the prospect of the arrival of their new
squire and his bride and all the high jinks of their reception.
Why did you ask such questions, Hetty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, Jimmy, you always look as solemn as a
hearse!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do I? Well, in view of coming events, I cannot be expected
to look very merry, can I, Hetty?” he inquired,
rather evasively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You refer to the expected arrival of the fraudulent
claimant and bigamous husband, and your duty to strike
him down,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Even in his pitch of pride.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But I don’t see why that should make you look so solemn.
And Jennie home, too! And the dear baby! Oh, Jimmy,
if you cannot appreciate the blessings around you and be
grateful and happy in the midst of them, the Lord help
you! though He certainly has a discouraging job of you,
just now!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“I preach to my people and weary them, no doubt. You
preach to me and—avenge them!” laughed the Reverend
James.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am glad to see you laugh, even if it is at my
expense,” said Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you two quarreling about?” inquired Jennie,
who had put her baby to sleep and now entered the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As to which is the best preacher, your mother of myself,”
answered the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, mamma! out and out! I have often wished I could
hear her in the pulpit!” laughed Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That settles it! Hetty, you have gained the point!”
said the Rev. James, as he strolled out of the parlor into
his study.</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife’s words had not been without their effect. He
was just now surrounded with such bright blessings, living
in such an atmosphere of love, peace, health, comfort, and
happiness that nothing could be added to their blessedness;
yet their very perfection troubled him, lest they should not
be permanent. He could not enjoy this blessed time, because
next month or next year might bring a change which
might be for the worse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why, what base thanklessness and faithlessness was this!
While he “preached to others” he was himself “a castaway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he resolved that he would reform all this. He would
take no anxious care for the future. He would do the best
he could and leave the rest to the Lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>From that day he presented a more cheerful aspect to his
family.</p>

<p class='c009'>The leading parishioners began to call on his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Partly from hearsay and partly from inference, they had
got a mixed opinion about the status of the young woman.
She was the wife—so they Lad heard—of one Capt. Kightly
Montgomery, son of the late General the Honorable Arthur
Montgomery, and grandson of the late and nephew of the
present Earl of Engelwing; that the captain was now, of
course, with his regiment in India, and that his young wife
had come home with her infant on a long visit to her father,
because the climate of India was so fatal to young children
of European parentage.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Under these mingled impressions of truth and error they
called to pay their respects to their pastor’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the village there came Mrs. and the Misses Leach,
the doctor’s wife and daughters; Mrs. Drum, the lawyer’s
mother, and the Misses Lesmore, the draper’s sisters, and
several widows and maidens living on their annuities. From
the country came Lady Nutt, of Nuttwood, the widow of a
civil engineer who had been knighted for some special merit
by the queen; the three Misses Frobisher, “ladies of a certain
age,” co-heiresses of Frobisher Frowns, a queer and
gloomy mansion on the moor, which stood against a bank
crowned with dark evergreen trees that bent over the roof
of the house, like towering brows on a human face—thence
I suppose the quaint if not forbidding name.</p>

<p class='c009'>These were all. Others of the county gentry belonging to
that neighborhood were absentees.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie as well as her mother was much pleased with the
hearty, homely, cordial manners of these Yorkshire country
people. But the better she liked the more she dreaded them!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, mamma!” she said, “I fear they cannot know my
real position here! They cannot know that I am a forsaken
wife! Why, yesterday old Lady Nutt patted my head and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I can feel for you, my dear. I had a niece in the H. E.
I. C.’s service, and she had to come home with her young
children and leave them here with their grandmother while
she went back to him. Do you intend to stay here with your
child, or leave it here with your parents and join the captain
in India?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, mamma, in all innocence the dear old lady asked
me that question! And my cheeks burned like fire as I answered
her the truth and said, ‘I intend to stay here with
my baby, my lady.’ She said, ‘That is right,’ and kissed me
and went away before you came in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is a good old soul,” was Hetty’s only comment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, mamma, but you have missed the point I wished to
make. It is so embarrassing to have people call on me and
make remarks that I must either correct by telling them
plainly how I am situated, or else that I must pass unnoticed,
as if they were true, and so, as it were, silently indorse
a false view.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, I don’t see how you can help yourself. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>cannot blow a trumpet before you proclaiming to all and
sundry the wickedness of your husband in deserting you,
his lawful wife, and marrying, feloniously, another woman!
You cannot even tell that to your visitors in confidence. It
would not become you to do so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, mamma, dear, I cannot; but some day some visitor
will innocently ask me some straightforward, plain question,
which will require an answer, involving a confession
of my real position. Oh! what shall I do in such a case?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child, wait until that day comes and that question
is asked. That will be time enough to worry about it.
Jennie! the secret of peace is the practice of faith. Do your
present duty, bear your present burden, enjoy your present
blessings, and leave the future to the Lord. You have nothing
to do with it. For you it has not even an existence,”
said Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early in December news came in a letter from Mr. Randolph
Hay, in Paris, to his bailiff, Mr. John Prowt, announcing
the return of the squire, with his wife and a party
of friends, to spend the Christmas holidays at the Hall.
The house was to be made ready for them by the fifteenth of
the month.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again all the estate, all the village and all the surrounding
country were agog with anticipations of the free festivities
that should glorify the triumphal entry of the new
squire upon his paternal estate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every one who came to call at the rectory talked of nothing
but the expected event.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the next Sunday morning the Rev. Mr. Campbell
preached an awful warning from the text:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit
before a fall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And in the afternoon he preached a similar jeremiad
from another text:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading
himself like a green bay tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet he passed away, and lo! he was not; yea, I sought
him, but he could not be found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of the week there came dire news to the
parish. A telegram from his attendant physician in Cannes
announced to Mr. Campbell the death of his rector, the
Rev. Dr. Orton, and added that his body would be brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>to the rectory to be interred under the chancel of the Haymore
church.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rev. James Campbell had been prepared for this
blow for many weeks, or at least he thought he had been so;
yet when it fell it nearly overwhelmed him. He was grieved
for the loss of his friend and he was perplexed for his
household. At first he did not know what to do at all. He
was not a man of resources. Should he immediately vacate
the rectory with his family, and go to the village tavern,
horrid, beery place, with a bar and taproom, or should he
seek lodgings in the village, dreadful, little, stuffy rooms, in
such a place, or should he remain at the rectory until the
arrival of the family with the remains of the deceased?</p>

<p class='c009'>At the church he must remain, of course; but at the rectory
when the family of the late rector were returning with
his remains.</p>

<p class='c009'>The family of the late rector, by the way, consisted of an
aged widow and a maiden daughter, both of whom were
with him at Cannes, and two unmarried sons, one a professor
at Oxford, and the other a popular preacher in London.
The curate consulted his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Telegraph the widow and know her will before you take
any step,” was Hetty’s advice, and Jimmy acted upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few hours came a courteous answer from Miss Orton,
saying, in effect, that Mr. Campbell was by no means to disturb
himself or his family. That the delicate condition of
the widow’s health must prevent her from leaving a sunny
climate for a frosty one at this severe season; that the
daughter would stay with her mother; that the remains of
the deceased rector would be accompanied by his two sons,
and taken directly from the train to the chancel of the
church, where the second funeral services would be held on
Friday, at 4 P. M. (the first having been held at Cannes),
immediately after which the sons would leave for London
and Oxford. So the curate’s family need not be disturbed
in the rectory until the appointment of the new rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Until the appointment of the new rector!’ How long
reprieve would that be?” inquired the curate. And then he
blamed himself for his selfishness in thinking so much of
his own and his family’s interests, when he should be thinking
only of his departed friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Friday morning the parish church at Haymore was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>decked in solemn funeral array to receive the remains of its
rector. The pulpit, altar and chancel were draped with
crape. Places of business and schools were all closed for
the day, and all the parishioners filled the church, many in
deep mourning, and all the others with some badge of
mourning on their dresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife and daughter of the curate sat in the rectory
pew. There, later, they were joined by the two sons of the
deceased rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate, in full vestments, waited the arrival of the
casket, and, book in hand, went to meet it at the church
door, through which, upon a bier of ebony, covered with a
pall of black velvet, it was borne by six bearers, and marshaled
it up the aisle and before the chancel, repeating the
sublime words of our Lord:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the resurrection and the life. He that liveth and
believeth on me shall never die. And he that believeth on
me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the bier, with the casket, was set down before the
altar, and the chief mourners—the two sons of the deceased,
who had followed it—had taken their seats in the rectory
pew, then the funeral services, conducted by the curate,
went on to their solemn ending.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the close the parishoniers came out of their pews in
an orderly manner, and passing on from the right to the left
before the casket, took their last look at the mask of their
deceased pastor.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the door of the crypt below the chancel was
opened, and the pallbearers bore the casket down the narrow
stairs and laid it in the leaden coffin and lifted it to the
stone niche prepared to receive it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the “dust to dust” was spoken, and the minister
came up again, went to the altar, pronounced the benediction,
and so dismissed the congregation.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the two sons of the late rector came out of their pew
they met and shook hands with the curate, but declined his
invitation to the rectory, saying that they were about to
return immediately to Cannes, to remain with their widowed
mother for the few days in which they would absent
themselves from their professional duties.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they took leave of the curate and his wife and daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>entered a carriage that was waiting, and drove off to
their train.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate, leaving his parishioners talking together in
groups in the churchyard, while the sexton was closing up
the church, followed his wife and daughter through the gate
in the wall that divided that cemetery from the rectory
grounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went directly to his study to compose himself before
joining his wife and daughter in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what he found there did not tend to his composure.
A letter, with a Paris postmark, was lying on the table. He
dropped into a chair and took it. At first he thought it
must be from Kightly Montgomery, whom he knew to be
flourishing in Paris under the name of Randolph Hay; but
a moment’s reflection assured him that the false claimant
was not likely to know of the accident of James Campbell’s
temporary charge of the Haymore parish.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened the letter, glanced at the signature, and saw
that it was not a stranger’s, and then read as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Reverend and Dear Sir</span>: I learned with extreme grief
a few days ago of the lamented death of the late honored
rector of Haymore. I immediately came over to the city to
see my brother-in-law, Mr. Hay, and apply to him for the
living which is in his gift. He has been pleased to bestow
it on me. My induction will date from the first of January
next. I do not wish to inconvenience you, but I should be
obliged if you could vacate the rectory in time to have the
house prepared for my reception. Mr. Randolph Hay and
his wife will be going to Haymore Hall for the Christmas
holidays with a party of friends, of which, at his invitation,
I have the happiness to make one. We shall, therefore, soon
meet at Haymore. With best respects to Mrs. Campbell, I

now?” moaned the curate, covering his eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='large'>THE CURATE’S TROUBLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After brooding over this disastrous letter for a long
hour the curate summoned enough courage to arise and go
to his wife and take counsel with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was, indeed, a trouble that he dared not keep from
her, even to spare her from anxiety; for it was absolutely
necessary that they should take immediate measures for removal
from the rectory and settlement in lodgings somewhere
in the town before the arrival of the new incumbent;
or, so at least it seemed to the curate in his dismayed state
of mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went directly into the back parlor, where the fire was
burning cheerfully in the grate, the tea table was set, and
Hetty resting in her low rocking-chair on the rug.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is Jennie?” inquired the curate, dropping into
another chair beside his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In her bedroom, putting her baby to sleep,” replied
Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am glad the child is not here just now. I have
bad news to tell you, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh? Bad news? What is it, Jimmy? But, dear me,
don’t look so dreadfully cast down! It cannot be such awfully
bad news, since you, I, Jennie and the baby are all
safe and sound in the house. But what, then, is your bad
news?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have lost my position here, and we shall have to leave
the rectory,” replied Mr. Campbell in a tone of despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me take a look at you?” said his wife, rising, giving
him her hand, helping him to his feet, and surveying him
all around. “Well, I don’t see that you have lost a limb, or
any mental or bodily faculty, that you need look so woebegone!
As for losing your position, of course you lost that
when the old rector died; and as for leaving the rectory, we
all knew that we should have to do that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but not so soon. We shall have to vacate by the
first of January.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that gives us plenty of time to choose new lodgings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>I would not ‘fash my beard’ about that, if I were
you, Jimmy! But why must we move by that time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because my successor, or rather Dr. Orton’s successor,
is appointed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Already!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon my word, there has been but little time lost! And
you have received notice to quit?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, in a letter from the new incumbent, which I found
lying on my study table when I came in from the church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is he, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Who is he?’ That is the very worst of all. Do you
remember that fellow, Cassius Leegh, who used to come to
Medge parsonage long ago and fasten on us for weeks?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was the son of a small shopkeeper in the borough,
London, studied for the ministry as a matter of pride and
ambition; but, morally and spiritually, as unfit for the pulpit
as a man can well be! I do not know how he has contrived
to get himself inducted into this living, except upon
the basis that he and the new squire are birds of a feather!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop!” exclaimed Hetty as a sudden light dawned on
her mind—“I understand it all perfectly now! Don’t you
know that this man, this so-called new squire of Haymore,
married in New York a young lady by the name of Leegh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I paid no attention to the name of the lady,” replied
the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, naturally I did, being a woman, you know. And
the bride’s name was Leegh! And surely you have heard
Cassius Leegh speak of his beautiful sister Lamia, who was
taken up by a wealthy New York family?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—yes—certainly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is it, then. This man Leegh, no doubt, sought out
his brother-in-law and put in his plea for the living, even
before Dr. Orton was dead, and so he has secured it, and
lost no time in warning you out. But I wonder if he happened
to mention your name to the ‘squire,’ for if so, the
said squire, finding out that you were here, would scarcely
venture to set foot within the place until you should be
gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Mr. Campbell emphatically; “knowing the
man as well as I do, I can say most positively that he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>never mentioned my name to his patron, or even alluded to
the fact that the late Dr. Orton left a temporary substitute
to fill his pulpit, when he himself went away for his health,
lest, you see, the knowledge of this fact should cause the
squire to take more time in appointing Dr. Orton’s successor.
Don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. To leave the absent squire to believe that the parish
of Haymore was entirely destitute of a pastor, would, of
course, hasten the patron, who wishes the good opinion of
his people, to appoint an incumbent, and the most natural
thing would be to appoint his brother-in-law. I wish he
were a better man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So do I, with all my heart!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! we are in Heaven’s hands. And as we must clear
out by the first of January, and get into new lodgings somewhere
or other, I will go out the first thing after breakfast
to-morrow morning to look them up,” said Hetty cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lodgings in this town!” ruefully grunted the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They needn’t be in this town. There are, no doubt,
plenty of farmhouses in the surrounding country where we
may get them very cheap, and very wholesome and pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but how are we to pay, even for the cheapest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jimmy Campbell! You a minister of the gospel, and
have no more faith than to ask such a question! If you
have lost your position here, and if we must leave the pleasant
rectory, still we are three able-bodied people, who, if
we do the best we can, and work at any honest thing our
hands may find to do, will be helped by the Lord, and will
do very well and pay our way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Hetty, my dear, you have had no experience in a
bitter struggle with the world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I have not, it is well, perhaps, that I should have.
And I am ready to engage in the struggle, though I do not
see why it need be a bitter one, but just a healthful one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have a healthful nature, dear, that is certain. As
for me, I sometimes think I am falling weak in body and
in mind,” sighed the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, dear Jimmy; not weak, only overworked and
weary. Why, you have not had a vacation for eighteen
years, to my certain knowledge. So long a strain might
have made an idiot or a ‘damp, unpleasant corpse’ of any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>man less strong and brave than yourself,” said the wife with
affectionate fervor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It helps me to see your faith in me, dear,” he sighed as
he took her hand and pressed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As for me, Jimmy, I am glad that you will be obliged
to rest for a few weeks or months. Don’t doubt. You must
rest. It is our turn now. Mine and Jennie’s. We must
work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You! What in this world could you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good many things. We—Jennie and I—could teach
English and French, music and drawing, to young ladies, or
A B C’s to little children. Failing that, we could take in
dressmaking or plain sewing. Failing that, I could go out
as sick nurse, and Jennie could do up fine laces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hetty, you talk wildly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. Unless you preach wildly. I am only
going to put into practice what you preach. You tell the
artisans and agricultural laborers that work is worship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would not mind your teaching——” slowly began the
curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you would not,” promptly assented his wife;
“and I should prefer it. Teaching is, conventionally, considered
a very ‘genteel’ occupation for a poor lady. And
for that, and a few other unworthy reasons, I would rather
teach than do anything else. But if I cannot get teaching to
do I hope I am Christian enough to take whatever work I
can get, whether it should be dressmaking, plain sewing,
sick nursing, or—washing and ironing. There! Even
that! I am ashamed of myself for even preferring a ‘genteel’
occupation to an humble one which is equally useful.
But I won’t let my feelings govern me in this; and so sure
as you have to leave your situation here, you shall take a rest
after twenty years’ hard labor, and Jennie and I will go to
work at whatever we can get to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hetty, you amaze and distract me! You do, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, Jim. I have not kept my eyes shut all my
life, and this is what I have seen—many unsuccessful professional
‘gentlemen and ladies,’ who have not talent enough
to climb where ‘there is more room higher up,’ or even to
keep their footing on the level where they were born, but
yet who will struggle, slip, flounder, suffer and sin where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>they are rather than take a step ‘lower down,’ as they would
consider it, but where there is also ‘more room.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t quite follow you, Hetty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is what I mean: Take an illustration. A man
may be an unsuccessful lawyer, but his knowledge of law
would make him so much better a clerk that his chances of
employment in that capacity would be much greater than
those of other competitors. Another man may fail as a minister,
but he might make all the better schoolmaster. A
woman may fail as a teacher, but succeed as a nurse. And
what I would both inculcate and practice is this: That
when man or woman fails in the line of life they have been
born into or chosen for themselves, and when they have
neither the power to rise above the level or to keep their
footing upon it, let them not give up in despair or struggle
in vain, but step frankly down to an humbler and honester
position. There is always some work of some sort to be got.
He who said ‘Six days shalt thou labor’ will give work to
every hand willing to take it, though it may not be the kind
of work their pride would like best. As for me and my
daughter, whatever our ‘hands find to do, we will do it with
our might,’ whether we like it or not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear, do you really not care about leaving this
beautiful home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under the circumstances, I should not care to stay, even
if we could. Should you? Reflect. The new squire will be
here in a few days. You will have to denounce him as an
impostor, a fraudulent claimant, a bigamous bridegroom.
But it would take time to prove these charges. Could you
stay in the parish and preach in the church during that
time with any sort of peace to us all? No. Better
that we should go away, and the sooner we go the
better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, I shall easily prove the fellow to be a bigamist;
but as his crime was committed in the United States
of America, I cannot prosecute him for it here in England.
Neither can I prove him to be a fraudulent claimant. I
have been turning that matter over in my mind, and I do
not even know that he is one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” exclaimed Hetty with wide-open eyes. “You
do not know him to be a fraudulent claimant when you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>know that his name is Kightly Montgomery, and that he
calls himself Randolph Hay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, my love. I know nothing of the conditions of
inheritance that rule this estate. I know nothing of the
history of the family or their intermarriages with other
families. How should I, coming here a stranger from the
south of England?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think it could not require much experience to
teach you that when a man’s name is Kightly Montgomery
and he calls himself Randolph Hay, he is a liar, swindler
and an impostor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But consider, dear, he may he next of kin and heir-at-law,
and his name now have been legally changed as the
condition of his inheritance. His mother or his grandmother
may have been born a daughter of Hay, of Haymore.
The estate may have ‘fallen to the distaff,’ as it is called—that
is, to the female line, and so the heir through that line
might be obliged to take the family name as the condition
of his heirship. Now do you see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I see what you mean. But your theory has so
many ‘mays’ that it won’t do. As for me, I prefer to think
the villain a fraudulent claimant as well as a bigamous
bridegroom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were interrupted by a ring at the doorbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell went to answer it. It was his custom always,
when at home, to do so, to save the steps of the rectory’s
one elderly servant-woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a hanging lamp in the little hall between the
parlor and the study that gave but a subdued light. They
had no gas, and oil was dear, and economy necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell opened the door, expecting to see no one
but the little old sexton. He saw, instead, the tallest and
finest looking athlete he had ever seen in or out of a circus;
but he could not distinguish his features.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Rev. Mr. Campbell?” said the stranger interrogatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is my name. What can I do for you?” inquired
the curate, who, now that his eyes had got used to the obscurity,
saw that the collossus was clothed from head to heel
in an outlandish costume of dressed buckskin trimmed with
fur, and that his stature was heightened, and his face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>shortened by the tall fur cap he wore pulled low down over
his forehead and ears, for the night was cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My name is Longman—Samson Longman, at your service,
sir. I have been directed by the people at Chuxton to
come to you, sir, for information concerning one Elizabeth
Longman, widow——” The speaker’s voice trembled and
broke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mother!” said the curate gravely. “She is well
and happy as she can be, without the son she is always
pining for and praying for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven be praised for that! And may the Lord forgive
me. Where is she, sir, if you please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With us here in the house, our cherished housekeeper,
almost our mother——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank the Lord! Can I see her, sir, now, at once? I
have come a long way to ask her forgiveness at last, and to
stay with her forever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come into my study. We must prepare her for the sight
of her son, for although she seems to be always expecting
you, yet the sudden meeting might be too much for her,”
said the curate as he closed the front door after the entrance
of his visitor and led the way into the study.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mr. Longman, sit down here at my desk and write
a letter to your mother. It need be only a line or so, to
give me the means of breaking the glad tidings safely to
her ears,” said Mr. Campbell as he turned up the light of
the study lamp and placed a chair for the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman obeyed like a child, and sat down and wrote his
letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will that do?” he inquired as he put the sheet of paper
into the curate’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! that will do very well. Now put it into an envelope
and seal and direct it regularly,” said the curate
when he had read and returned the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Longman obeyed like a child, and when he had
sealed the letter, arose and placed it in the hands of the
curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Resume your seat and wait for my return,” said Mr.
Campbell as he left the study.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went first into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty was still sitting there alone. Jennie was still with
her baby in the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Who was that, Jim? A man come to serve you with a
writ of eviction?” inquired Hetty mischievously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hardly, my dear. But I am sure you will be happy to
hear who it was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who was it, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Elspeth Longman’s prodigal son returned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-h-h, Jim!” exclaimed Hetty, jumping up, her face
perfectly radiant with benevolent delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear. And now, if you please, I will take you to
see him in the study, where you can talk to him while I go
and break these ‘glad tidings of great joy’ to the poor, long-suffering
mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! I would love to go! What is the boy like?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Boy?’ ‘Like?’ He is like the Apollo Belvedere, or
like the Colossus of Rhodes. A superb, a stupendous fellow.
But all dressed in hides like a North American Indian, or
a prehistoric Norseman. But come and see!” said Mr.
Campbell, leading the way to the study.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty followed, now half anxious, half afraid to see the
savage.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they entered Longman, seeing the lady, arose, bowed
and handed a chair with so much ease, dignity and grace
that Mrs. Campbell was surprised, pleased and reassured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Longman, this lady is my wife. She will entertain
you while I go to your mother,” said the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman bowed more profoundly than before, and murmured
something to the effect that he was most honored
and grateful to be permitted to make the lady’s acquaintance;
but the hunter was always shy in the society of gentlewomen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Mr. Campbell, knowing that Hetty could give the
prodigal son more satisfactory information about his mother
in five minutes than any other creature could in five years,
went out and left them together.</p>

<p class='c009'>He passed through the parlor and opened the kitchen
door. He saw Elspeth sitting before the stove, knitting,
while she waited for her muffins to bake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you come into the parlor for a moment? I wish to
speak to you, Mrs. Longman,” said the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” replied the woman, rising and untying her
kitchen apron, which she took off and hung over the back
of her chair. Then she went into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Take Mrs. Campbell’s rocking-chair while we talk. Save
your back whenever you can, Mrs. Longman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, sir, it better becomes me to stand in your reverence’s
presence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, sit down. No, but I insist upon it. I have something
to say to you which cannot be said in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The widow sighed profoundly and sank into the easy-chair.
She thought she knew what was coming. Without
the least intention of eavesdropping, she had heard enough
of the conversation that had that evening passed between
the minister and his wife—and which, by the way, had never
been intended to be concealed—to know that they expected
to leave the rectory under such reverse of fortune as would
compel them to use the closest economy in their domestic
arrangements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore Elspeth thought that she had been summoned
to the parlor to receive her “warning” or her discharge.
And she felt not so sorry for herself in the prospect of losing
a good home as for the curate and his wife on having to
dispense with her services. She was turning over in her
meek mind the question of how, without seeming presumptuous,
she could offer to remain with them and serve them
without wages, just so long as her strength and also her
clothes and shoes should last, and if they could afford to
keep her even on such easy terms as her board and lodging.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell broke gently in upon her troubled thoughts
by asking her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you ever received any letter from your son since
he has been away, Mrs. Longman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not one, sir, though I feel sure in my mind that he has
writ to me, maybe many letters, and they have all gone
astray; and then what hurts me worst of all is that he may
think I must have got some of his letters and as I was too
mad at him and too unforgiving to answer any of them.
And I don’t even know where to write to tell him any
better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But when at last you meet, face to face, then you can
tell him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, sir. And I know that we shall meet again. He
who raised the widow’s son from his bier will hear the poor
old widowed mother’s prayer, and bring her boy back.
Though it seems long! Oh, it seems long! But all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>while it comforts me to think that if I don’t know where he
is, the Lord does! If I can’t see him, the Lord can! And
I may pray to the Lord for my boy and He will hear me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How old are you, Mrs. Longman?” was the curate’s next
seemingly irrelevant question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forty-three, sir; will be forty-four on the thirty-first of
December. But I must look full sixty, my hair is so white,
and my face so thin and wrinkly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you have good health, and you Yorkshire people
are long-lived. You may live forty years longer yet—forty
happy years with your son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, minister! what does your reverence mean? Have
you heard anything? Have you got anything to tell me?”
inquired the mother, startled by something in the curate’s
tone or look, and speaking with repressed eagerness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, something has come. Have you anybody who
would be likely to write a letter to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody in the world, sir, except my boy, and I have
never had a letter from him, as I told you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, a letter has come for you. I did not give it at
first, for fear it might startle you. I think it must be from
your son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, give it to me, sir, please!—now, this moment!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate handed the letter. The woman seized it, held
it under the light of the lamp and devoured the superscription
with ravenous eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! It is his writing! It is his own! Oh, thank
the Lord! Oh, thank the Lord!” she cried, falling on her
knees and sinking her head in the cushion of the chair.
But she soon arose and drew her spectacles from her pocket
and opened the letter and tried to read it; but the words ran
together in dark lines before her disturbed vision, and she
could not decipher them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, sir, be so kind! Read it for me! Please do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure,” said Mr. Campbell. And he took the
letter, and omitting date, read as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘<span class='sc'>My Beloved Mother</span>——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The darling boy!” ejaculated Elspeth in rapture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I have crossed the sea and come back to England——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is in England! In England! Oh, thank Heaven!
Thank Heaven! Go on, sir! Please go on!” impatiently
exclaimed Elspeth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The curate smiled at her impetuosity and continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘To see your dear face again, and to beg your forgiveness,
which I know you will grant me, though I know I do
not deserve it——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, hear the noble fellow! Taking all the blame on
himself, though I was more in fault nor him! But go on,
sir! Pray go on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I long to be with you, to stay with you all the rest of
our lives; to work for you, and to try to make you happy
and comfortable, and so atone for all the trouble I have
caused you——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! the grand son! the noble boy! He will stay with
me all the rest of my life! Oh, that will be joyful!” exclaimed
Elspeth, clapping her hands and breaking into a
camp meeting revival hymn, very appropriate, it is true:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Oh! that will be joyful!</div>

      <div class='line in2'>To meet and part no more!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“It will be like heaven, sir! like heaven! to have my boy
with me all the rest of my life! But do go on, sir! Forgive
a poor mother’s impatience, and read me what else he
says!” she cried, ready to turn from rapture to tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is not much more,” said Mr. Campbell. “Only
this:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Please, dearest mother, if you can pardon me, let me
know when I can come to see you. And believe me your
sincerely penitent and evermore loving and dutiful son,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<span class='sc'>Sam</span>.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! the darling of darlings! the angel of angels! Oh,
please, dear minister, write for me directly, for I never can
hold a pen in the hand that is trembling for joy and blessedness
and gratitude, and tell him to come immediately. But,
no! I will go to him! Where is he? I’ll get the Red Fox
carryall and start for the station immediately. Truly,
where shall I go? Tell me, minister, dear! Look at the
letter! Where is it dated from?” she eagerly demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will not have far to go. He is in this village,” said
Mr. Campbell, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“In this village! Oh! then he is at the Red Fox! Let
me get my bonnet and cloak!” she cried, rising to her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is nearer to you than that,” said the minister. Then
he drew the woman’s arm within his own and led her into
the study.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother!” exclaimed Longman, starting up and striding
toward her with outstretched arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my darling! my darling!” cried Elspeth, and she
fell fainting on his bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'>So much for the careful breaking of the news.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she did not swoon to unconsciousness. She almost
immediately recovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Longman seated her in the large armchair, and
placed himself on the hassock at her feet. She put her arms
over his shaggy head and smiled through her tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come!” said Hetty, laughing. “You and I are <i><span lang="fr">de trop</span></i>
in a room with such a pair of lovers as these!” And she
slipped her hand through her husband’s arm and dragged
him from the room without the reunited pair—so absorbed
in their meeting—seeing them go.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='large'>THE SQUIRE’S ARRIVAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Hetty drew her husband back into the cozy parlor, where
they found Jennie waiting alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I have put the baby to sleep at last! Little witch!
she wanted to laugh and crow and kick all night. Such a
time as I had getting her quiet! But where have you two
been? You look—just as if you had come from a circus!”
said Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So we have! or rather from a domestic drama!” exclaimed
Hetty, laughing; and then she told her daughter all
about the sudden return of Samson Longman, and the joy
of his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie listened in sympathetic delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, my dear, you may come in the kitchen and
help me to bring in the tea. Elspeth has forgotten that
there is any such thing as tea in the world. And who can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>blame her!” exclaimed Hetty as she left the room attended
by her daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was, indeed, nearly an hour beyond their usual tea
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tea was drawn too much, and the muffins were baked
too dry; nevertheless, father, mother, and daughter enjoyed
the refreshment.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a good-sized dining-room in the rear of the
house on the other side of the hall, but for reasons of economy
it was not used in cold weather, as it would require another
fire, the meals being served in the family sitting-room
or parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, however, as soon as the curate and his family arose
from the tea, his wife said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jimmy, we must be kind. The kindlings and coal are
all laid in the grate of the back room ready for lighting a
fire when required. Do, dear, go and start it; and Jennie
and I will clear off this tea table, and set another in there
for Elspeth and her big boy to take their tea comfortably;
for it is not every day that a prodigal son returns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you just know how it is yourselves, don’t you, papa
and mamma?” inquired the prodigal daughter, tenderly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, we do; and I will go right off and do as you wish,”
exclaimed the curate merrily as he left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty and Jennie went eagerly to work, and soon cleared
away their own table, and then went and set one in the
dining-room, where the curate had already kindled a good
fire in the grate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty brought out from all the treasures of pantry and
cupboard, and in addition to the substantial fare of cold
beef and ham, cheese, bread and butter, she laid out cake,
honey and sweetmeats.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all this was done she made a large pot of fresh tea
and set it to draw. Finally she returned to the parlor and
sat down with her husband and daughter in pleasant expectancy
for developments from the study.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had not to wait long. Very soon came Elspeth into
the parlor, her eyes shining with happiness, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you please, sir, Samson—that is my boy—would like
to thank you and say good-evening before he goes away.”
Then noticing for the first time that the tea table had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>cleared away, she started with a little look of dismay, and
before anybody could speak again, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I am so sorry! I clean forgot! I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say another word, dear woman. It is all right—quite
right. Jennie and I did all that was necessary, and
took pleasure in doing it. And as for your boy saying
good-night and going away before he has broken bread with
you, that cannot be permitted on any account. There!
take him into the dining-room, where you will find a fine
fire, and a tea table, and a pot of tea simmering on the hob.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma’am, but you are too good!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense! I’m delighted—we are all delighted! And,
Elspeth, when you have had your tea, bring your boy in to
us while you go upstairs and make him up a bed in the little
spare room next to your own. Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma’am, you are too good! Whatever shall I do to
repay your kindness!” exclaimed the grateful creature, with
eyes full of tears, as she lifted Hetty’s hand and pressed it
to her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do just as she tells you, Mrs. Longman. And say to
your son that we should be pleased to have him remain
here with you until after Christmas. He shall be most cordially
welcome to us all,” added Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless you, sir, for your great kindness; for indeed
it will be a great joy to me to have my boy under the very
same roof with me for a few days, now that he has come
back,” said Elspeth, her wintry face in an April aspect of
smiles and tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, of course, it is a delight to us to be able to contribute
to your happiness, you know,” said Mr. Campbell
cheerily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elspeth dropped her old-fashioned courtesy and went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>And very soon the three remaining in the parlor heard
the mother and her son going down the passage to the rear
dining-room that was behind the study.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty and Jennie took their needlework, and Mr. Campbell
picked up the morning paper, which no one had had
time to look at all day long, and began to read to them
items of news.</p>

<p class='c009'>So an hour passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reunited mother and son lingered long in the dining-room,
but at length they came out and entered the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Longman went at once up to Mr. Campbell and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, I thank you very much for the hospitality you have
so kindly proffered me, and which, for my mother’s sake,
I am very happy to accept.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mention it, Mr. Longman. Have a seat. This
is my daughter, Mrs. Montgomery,” said the curate, rising
and handing a chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman bowed profoundly to the young lady, and then
dropped into his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elspeth was speaking to Mrs. Campbell:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which room did you say, ma’am, he might have?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any vacant one you please. The little room next to
your own you might prefer, perhaps,” returned Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, I would, thanky, ma’am,” said Elspeth, and
she left the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did you reach England, Mr. Longman?” inquired
Hetty, to make conversation and set the embarrassed colossus
at his ease.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only about twenty-four hours since, ma’am. And I
had the honor of traveling in company with the new Squire
of Haymore and his bride, expected by the people in this
neighborhood,” replied Longman, looking down on his own
folded hands, so that he failed to see the effect of his words;
for Mr. Campbell started, Hetty gasped, and Jennie turned
pale.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the conversation that followed was all at cross-purposes,
for Longman came to speak of Randolph Hay, the
only true Squire of Haymore, and his wife, Judith, and of
their crossing the Atlantic Ocean together; while the curate
and his family spoke of Kightly Montgomery, the fraudulent
claimant, and his deceived bride, Lamia Leegh, and of
their crossing the English Channel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Squire of Haymore and his lady are in England,
then?” was the remark with which the curate reopened the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. I had the honor of coming over in the same
steamer with them. We landed yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you left them in London?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beg pardon, sir, no. We traveled from London together.
We reached Chuxton this afternoon about sunset. We had
to wait there for a conveyance hither, and while we waited,
and Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay and their party took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>luncheon, I went in search of my dear mother, expecting to
find her there where I had left her, but I heard instead that
she was living at the rectory with your family. So then I
told Mr. Randolph Hay, and he very kindly offered me a
seat in his carriage, and so brought me on here. I rode to
the Hall with them, and there left them and walked on
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you mean to say that the squire and his lady
are now really at the Hall?” demanded the astonished curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, as I said, or should have said, they arrived
to-night a little after dusk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” continued the deeply perplexed curate, “I don’t
understand. The squire and—his lady were to have sent a
telegram from London announcing their approach, and
were expected to make quite a triumphal entry by daylight,
amid the ringing of bells and singing of children, and flinging
of flowers, and all the parade and pageantry that this
season would permit. Prowt, the bailiff, has had his orders
to be in readiness for weeks past, and for days has been
waiting a telegram.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know how that is, sir. I know that Mr. and
Mrs. Randolph Hay came home very quietly indeed,” replied
Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But was it not a great surprise, not to say shock, to the
servants at the Hall? And were they at all ready for the
squire and—his lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so, sir. I know Mr. Randolph Hay sent a dispatch
to the housekeeper at the Hall, with instructions to
have rooms aired and fires built, dinner prepared, and everything
in readiness to receive himself and his wife this evening.
I know it, sir, for I carried the dispatch to the telegraph
office myself,” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The people will be very much disappointed at missing
the pageantry,” remarked the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay cared for
display. I am a little surprised that it should have been
thought of in connection with them,” said Longman, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, man alive, it was by the squire’s own orders, without
the slightest suggestion from anybody here!” laughed
the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“It was not like him. A more modest and unpretending
gentleman I do not know anywhere in this world!” persisted
Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate repressed an inclination to utter a long, low
whistle; but he did say to himself: “So much for the blindness
of prejudice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I have just thought of it! I will tell you why I
think the triumphal entry was abandoned!” exclaimed
Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” inquired her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, on account of the death of the rector.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! to be sure! that was it; though it was a more
gracious thought than I should have given the man credit
for,” added Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment Elspeth came in, smiling. She had been
absent much longer than they had expected her to be; for
she had not only prepared the little spare bedroom for her
son, but she had washed up all her dishes and done all her
usual evening work. She carried a lighted candle in a low,
broad brass candlestick. She courtesied to the ladies and
gentleman, as was her custom, and then she said to her boy:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Sam, the room the kind master has given you
is all ready, and I will show it to you if you will come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Longman arose, bade good-night to his hosts, and
turned to leave the room, when Mr. Campbell said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But perhaps you would like to join us in our evening
service.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman bowed in silence, and resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Elspeth brightly. “Every night and morning
since I have been in this house has the minister prayed
for my wandering boy’s return, and now that he has come
we will give thanks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie arose and got the Bible and prayer book and laid
them before her father.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the evening service began.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of it Mr. Campbell did return “earnest and
hearty thanks” for the restoration of the widow’s son, and
prayed that all wanderers from the spiritual fold of the
Lord might likewise be brought back.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the service was over, Elspeth, after bidding good-night
to her friends, took up her candle and showed her boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the way to his bedroom. And soon after the minister and
his wife and daughter retired.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day was one of those benign autumn days that
sometimes revisit us even late in December, to encourage
and help us through the winter. The sky was radiantly
clear and the sun dazzlingly bright. The many evergreen
trees around the parsonage had something like the fresh
verdure of early spring upon them. It was a day that any
healthy person might have enjoyed the outdoor air without
much extra clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>After breakfast Longman went over to the Hall to see
his friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, standing together at the door,
watched him walking down the walled road that led to the
park gates.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is astonishing,” said the curate, “that so honest a
man as Longman should have such a respect for that villain
Montgomery as he appears to have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose the young fellow has never seen the villain’s
cloven foot, and men have no intuitions to guide them as
we have, you know,” replied Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, though the splendor of the day invited them to
remain outdoors, they went inside, each to his or her own
work.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister went to his study to work on his next Sunday
morning’s sermon. Hetty to her linen closet to look
over her stores for mending. Jennie, well wrapped up, to
take her baby, also warmly clad, through the garden walks.
Elspeth to her kitchen to wash up the breakfast service.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister, however, had scarcely got under way with
his manuscripts before the doorbell rang, and he sprang up
to answer it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prowt, the bailiff of Haymore, stood there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could I speak to your reverence a moment, sir?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. Come in,” replied Mr. Campbell, and led the
visitor into the study.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, minister,” said the bailiff, as soon as they were
both seated at the writing-table near the window, “it has
come at last. I have got a dispatch from the squire, announcing
his immediate arrival with his bride and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>brother-in-law, though not with the expected party of
friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The curate started, and then passed his hand across his
forehead, as if to clear away a cloud of perplexity. Had
not Longman told him that the squire and his lady had
arrived the night before? And he could not have made a
mistake, because he came with them, and left them at the
Hall. And now the bailiff tells him that he has received a
dispatch, announcing the immediate arrival of the squire
and his party. What did all this mean? At length an explanation
suggested itself, and he spoke upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has not that dispatch been delayed? Should it not have
come yesterday?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, sir! It was dated this morning, and came an
hour ago!” exclaimed the bailiff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you got it about you? Would you mind letting
me see it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here it is, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The bailiff drew the paper from his vest pocket and put
it into the hands of the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell opened it and read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Langham’s Hotel, London</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>“December 15, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>To Mr. John Prowt</span>, Haymore Lodge, Haymore,
Yorkshire: I shall arrive with my wife and brother-in-law,
the Rev. Cassius Leegh, by the one-thirty train, at Chuxton.
Send one comfortable carriage to meet us.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Randolph H. Hay.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell returned the slip of paper to the bailiff and
fell into silence. He could make nothing of it. He was
dumfounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you see it is all right, sir,” said the bailiff. “I shall
send the open barouche, as the day is so fine, and with two
footmen, besides the coachman. I suppose they will enter
this town about half-past two o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said the dazed curate, “what do you wish me
to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you would give orders to the bell ringers, sir, to be at
their post, and also have the parish school children drawn
up each side the road leading to the park gate——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“It is rather an unfavorable season—December—for
children to be parading outdoors,” suggested the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, sir, the kids can’t wear the white frocks and
pink sashes and wreaths of flowers on their bare heads, as
they could have done three months ago; but they can wear
their picturesque winter uniform of red cloaks and hoods,
and black woolen stockings and gloves; and as the weather
is so remarkably fine, and the hour just after noon, in the
warmest part of the day, I do not think the exposure will
hurt them. Do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“N-oo! I do not suppose it will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then will you kindly see to it, sir, that they are drawn
up in proper array, to sing their songs of welcome and throw
their flowers before the bridal pair?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where will they get flowers at this season of the year?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!—a—from the conservatories of the Hall, if from
no other place. I will see that they are sent over to the
schoolroom. I think, also, that many of the cottagers have
a few late flowers in their gardens, such as chrysanthemums
and dahlias and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you think, Mr. Prowt, that because a newly married
pair happens to be happy and prosperous, that living
and blooming flowers should be torn from their warm conservatories
and sunny gardens, to be thrown down in the
dirt to perish under carriage wheels, in their honor? I
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, minister, I never heard of such an objection!”
said the astonished bailiff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you hear it now. And it might be well for you to
think of it. The custom is a barbarous one, suitable only
to prehistoric savages.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The bailiff stared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Mr. Prowt, I wish to say this to you—with
the kindest feelings toward yourself, and with sincere regret
that I must disappoint you—that I cannot and will
not allow the church bells to be rung, or the parish children
to parade, or any single movement to be made in honor
of this incoming bridal pair which it is in my power to
prevent,” said the minister, all the more firmly because so
quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>The bailiff stared in silence, too astonished to speak for
a minute. Then he demanded:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why, in the name of Heaven, reverend sir, would
you put such an affront upon the new squire and his bride?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I put no affront upon them. I simply decline to show
them any honor whatever, or to allow any one under my
authority to do so,” emphatically responded the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But this is most amazing, sir. Why, if you please, do
you refuse to honor them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I cannot and must not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet, about three months ago, when there was first a talk
of the new squire bringing home his bride, there was no one
more interested than yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is true. But since that date circumstances have
come to my knowledge that have changed all my views, and
must change all my actions, toward the incoming squire and
his—lady; circumstances that quite justify me in my present
course of conduct.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I ask your reverence what those circumstances
are?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, Prowt. I cannot tell you. To-morrow or next
day the whole parish may know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am perplexed. But, reverend sir, I must at least
do my duty, and go over to the Hall to give directions there
for the proper reception of the new squire, and send the
carriage and servants to meet them. It is nine o’clock now,
and they really ought to be off. I hope you do not blame
me, sir, for doing my part.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not. You must do your duty by your employer,”
said Mr. Campbell kindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, sir,” said the bailiff, taking up his hat
to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-day, Mr. Prowt,” replied the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even when the visitor was gone and the curate was alone
he could not return to his manuscript sermon. It was impossible
to concentrate his thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, well,” he said at last, “I shall have to take out one
of my old Medge sermons for Sunday morning. It will be
new to these parishioners at least.” And then he closed his
desk, sat back in his armchair and gave himself up to the
problem that was disturbing his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>The dispatch from the squire lay on the table before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bailiff had inadvertently left it behind him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell took it up, again read it carefully, and
again passed his hand slowly over his forehead to clear away
the thick cloud of confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The situation seemed inexplicable.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no doubt that this dispatch, dated this morning,
signed Randolph Hay, and announcing the arrival of
the squire and of his wife and brother-in-law on this day,
was a perfectly genuine article and a very hard fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no doubt, either, that another Randolph Hay,
with his wife and friends, had arrived at Haymore Hall in
company with the indubitable traveling companion and eyewitness
who had reported the fact to the minister’s family.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now what on earth did it all mean?</p>

<p class='c009'>One Squire of Haymore and his wife at Haymore Hall,
and another Squire of Haymore and his—lady on their way
there!</p>

<p class='c009'>Would the two parties meet to-day, and if so, what then?</p>

<p class='c009'>The only possible theory of the situation, as it presented
itself to the minister’s mind, was this, upon which he finally
settled—that the Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay who had arrived
on the preceding evening and were now at the Hall
were the real lord and lady of the manor, and that the so-called
Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay who were expected to arrive
to-day were the fraudulent claimants whom he had taken
them to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had not breathed a syllable of the first arrival to the
bailiff, preferring to keep the matter to himself until he
should see Samson Longman, who had walked over that
morning to Haymore Hall, but would return to the rectory
by midday.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the backwoodsman came in a little sooner than he
had been expected. He came at once to the study door and
rapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell bade him enter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman’s face was radiant with merriment, and in his
hand he carried a letter, which he fondled playfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Longman, you have been to see your friends at
the Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please sit down and tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Longman settled himself in the largest leather chair, put
his fur cap down on the floor beside him and fondled his
letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You found the young squire and his wife quite well
after their journey?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite well, sir. And also very much delighted with
their new home, which they saw for the first time by daylight
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Longman, you are sparkling all over with repressed
amusement. What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anticipation of an entertainment at the Hall to-day,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I understand. Do your friends know that there
is another Mr. Randolph Hay and his—lady expected at the
Hall to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, sir,” exclaimed the giant, now bursting into a
storm of laughter, which had to have its full vent before he
could go on with his words. “Yes, sir. The bailiff came
there an hour ago, full of importance, to announce the fact.
He was somewhat amazed to find the young squire and his
wife already in possession. But they are quite ready for
the reception of the newcomers, sir, and that is the entertainment
I anticipate. Here, sir, is a letter the young
squire has intrusted to me to hand you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister took the missive, broke the seal and read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>

yet I have heard enough of you to engage my

come this evening to the Hall to discuss with me the subject

pleasure to offer you, in the hope that you may do me the
honor to accept it. May I presume, also, to ask you to waive
ceremony, and bring your wife and daughter with you on

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>The curate rushed out of the study and into the room
where his wife sat sewing in an avalanche of infirm linen
and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hetty, we need never leave the rectory! I have got the
Haymore living! Read that, and thank the Lord!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='large'>A MEMORABLE JOURNEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Yes, it was true! Randolph Hay, the rightful heir, was
in full possession of Haymore. He had also entered into
his estate with much more ease than could have been anticipated
either by himself, his friends or his lawyers.</p>

<p class='c009'>To explain how this happened, a brief summary of events
is necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be remembered that Ran Hay, with his young
bride, Judy, and a small party of friends, sailed on November
the 29th from New York by the steamship <em>Boadicea</em>,
hound for Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran, Judy and Will Walling had staterooms in the first
cabin; Mike, Dandy and Longman had berths in the second
cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>This arrangement, on the part of the three last mentioned,
was much against the will of Ran, who would gladly
have provided his brother-in-law and his two friends with
the best accommodations the ship afforded, but that from
very delicacy of feeling toward them he could not offer to
do so. Besides, he knew that all three of these men had
money enough to pay for a first-class passage each, had
they desired it, but that for prudential reasons Dandy and
Longman did not choose to squander their savings in that
needless manner, and that Mike cast in his lot with his two
friends; and so their little party voyaged in the plain but
clean and wholesome second cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>There could not, however, be much communication between
the three in the first cabin and the three in the second,
though they met occasionally on the common ground of the
forward deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Ran had long talks with his friends, and learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>much more of the past history of Dandy and Longman than
he had ever known before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, Judy, wrapped from head to heel in her heavy
fur cloak, would often join them, for the weather continued
fine. “Wonderful!—just wonderful!” was the verdict of all
the ship’s passengers; the oldest “salt” declaring that never,
at this season of the year, had he known such weather in
crossing the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one of our party suffered from seasickness. The only
effect the voyage seemed to have upon them was an increase
of health, vigor and appetite.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their ship was rather a slow one, that was all.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a splendid winter morning about the seventh day
out. The sky, of a clear, deep blue, without a single cloud,
and on fire with a sun too dazzling to be seen, overhung a
sea whose waves were like molten sapphires. The ship, with
all her snowy sails spread and filled, was flying on before a
fresh, fair wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the forward deck, grouped together, were Ran, Judy,
Mike, Dandy and Longman. The hunter had been telling
his story for the first time to Ran and Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you are from Chuxton! Is not that a strange
coincidence? Haymore Hall and hamlet is in the neighborhood
of Chuxton, I think,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About ten miles off, sir. Chuxton is the nearest market
town and railway station to Haymore,” replied Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear fellow, as you say you would never have
left your native country if you could have obtained employment
to suit you——” Ran said in a modest and hesitating
way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Among guns and game,” Longman interjected with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly—’among guns and game?—I do earnestly hope
that it may be in my way to suit you. Longman, I know
nearly nothing of my patrimonial estate, but I have heard
my father say that there was no such place for game in all
the North Riding. I hope and trust and pray,” added Ran,
with boyish earnestness, “that I may be able to make you
head gamekeeper at Haymore without injustice to others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would not take another man’s place to his hurt, sir,”
said the hunter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know that, good fellow. Nor would I offer you such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>an effront. But it will hurt no one to make you an extra
keeper at a good salary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, now, Longman! D’ye moind that? Isn’t it jist
what I was afther tilling ye!” exclaimed Mike. “Didn’t I
say if Ran, or bigging his honor’s pardin, Misther Hay,
hadn’t a place riddy made to shute ye, he’d crayate one?
D’ye moind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something like that,” replied the hunter, laughing.
“But I really do not wish Mr. Hay to make a place for
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Friends,” said the young squire, “we will leave that
question until we get to Haymore. But in the meantime
don’t distress me by calling me Mr.—anybody! I am Ran
to all my old companions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ouns! But whatever would the gintry round Haymore
be thinking to hear the squire called be his Christian name,
with divil a handle to it, be the loikes av us?” demanded
Mike, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not care what they think! They will soon know
that I and my Judy and my friends came from the mining
camps in the backwoods and mountains of North America,
and that they must not expect more polish from us or more
politeness than neighborly, loving kindness inspires. And
now, Dandy, old friend, what do you intend to do when we
all reach England?” inquired Ran of the old man, who
seemed to have been left out, or to have withdrawn himself
from the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, then, I don’t know, sir! I hevn’t a living soul
belonging to me in the old country except it is my brother’s
orphan child, my niece, Julia Quin. When I left England
she was a good-looking young wench, some seventeen years
old, and was at service in a parson’s family down in Hantz.
She’ll be married by this time, I reckon, with no end of
kids! But, anyways, I’ll look her up, sir, if she is to be
found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you ever heard from her since you left England?”
inquired Judy, breaking into the conversation the first time
for the last half hour, and interested the moment another
woman was brought upon the tapis.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’, no, Miss Judy!—which I beg your pardon. Mistress
Hay; but I do be forgetting sometimes. Neither me
nor mine was ever any great hand at letter writing. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>she was doing well at the vicarage, I knowed. And I was
wandering about, seeking of my fortin, which I never yet
found, though I might have found it the very next blow of
my pick, for aught I know, if I had had the parsaverance
to stay, which I couldn’t have after the boys here left, and
so for twenty years I haven’t heard a word of my niece. She
may be dead, poor wench; for death is no respecter of
persons, though she was a fine, strapping, strong wench,
too. Yes, that is so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope not. I hope she is alive and well for your sake.
Where did you say you left her at service?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the vicarage, ma’am, in my native town, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what town was that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Medge, ma’am. In Hantz, on the south coast, where I
was born and riz.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy had started at the first mention of Medge. Now
she hastily inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was the name of the vicar?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One Rev. Mr. Campbell, ma’am; the Rev. Mr. James
Campbell. He came from Scotland, horridonally; but settled
into the south coast of England. Yes, that was so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Ran was listening with the deepest interest
to the words of old Dandy, but leaving Judy to sustain the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mr. Quin, we know who he is,” she gayly exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know, ma’am? Indeed, and how, if you please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mr. Quin, it is too long a story to tell you how
now; and besides, it concerns other people that I would
rather not talk about; but this I can tell you, that the Rev.
Mr. Campbell is not now at Medge, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is he then, ma’am, if you please to tell me that
I may know where to seek for him? For I shall go to him
first of all to ask after my niece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is quite at the opposite end of England. He is at
Haymore Rectory, where we are all going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord be good to us! Is that so?” exclaimed Dandy
joyfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, yes! And now, Mr. Quin, if you wish to hear
news of your niece, Julia, you will have to go all the way
to Haymore with us. And I am so glad that we will not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>separated. It will be so pleasant for us all to go together
to Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Dandy, old boy, and you must stop with me, you
know, until you find your niece,” added Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And will I see the Rev. Mr. James Campbell himself?”
inquired Quin in some doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you will. And as servants don’t change places
as often in the old country as they do in the new, it is more
than likely you will find your niece at the rectory, unless she
is married,” said Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or—dead, poor wench!” added Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, indeed. She’s not dead! I’m certain of it,” exclaimed
Judy, with good-natured but inexcusable presumption.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take that for a prophecy, anyways, ma’am, and believe
into it. Yes, that is so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you will come with us to Haymore, Dandy?” said
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you kindly, sir; I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, Mr. Quin, stop calling me sir. You are an old
man and I am a young one, almost a boy, and it is not fitting
for you to call me sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Hay, I was brought up into the Church of England,
and teached to be content with that station of life into
which the Lord had called me; likewise, to respect my
pastors and masters, and to honor my sooperioors. And
twenty years’ wandering among the mines haven’t made me
forget them airly lessons, nor yet my good manners, sir,”
said Dandy, with a ceremonious bow, as he lifted his fur
cap from his bald head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judy, can’t you bring them to reason?” inquired Ran,
with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sorrow a worrd they’ll listen to meself!” exclaimed
Judy, backsliding into dialect, as she frequently did.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, do as you please, or I’ll make you!” laughed Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>And from that hour it was understood that the whole
party should keep together until they should reach Haymore,
instead of separating at Liverpool, as had been first
intended.</p>

<p class='c009'>The weather continued very fine, though very cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the morning of the tenth they reached Queenstown.</p>

<p class='c009'>There Mr. Walling went on shore and telegraphed to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>London correspondents, Messrs. Sothoron &#38; Drummond,
Attorneys-at-Law, Lincoln’s Inns Fields, that his client, Mr.
Randolph Hay, and himself would be in London on the
afternoon of the twelfth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The run from Queenstown to Liverpool was as fine as any
preceding part of the voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached port in the early dawn of the morning
on the twelfth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without lingering longer in the city than was necessary
to get their baggage through the customhouse and fortify
themselves with a substantial early breakfast at the
“Queen’s,” they took the first mail train for London, where
they arrived in the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Will Walling, an experienced traveler, who had been
in London several times before, became the guide of the
party, and took them from Euston Square down to Morley’s
Hotel, Trafalgar Square, where they secured a comfortable
suite of apartments on the second floor front.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike, Dandy and Longman went to find cheaper quarters.
Again Ran would gladly have entertained them at Morley’s,
but could not offer to do so without affronting their spirit
of independence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even Mike, to whom Ran ventured an invitation, declined
his brother-in-law’s hospitality, and cast in his lot with his
two old mining friends. But he promised to look in again
in the evening to let Ran and Judy know where he and his
companions had found quarters.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a hasty dinner in the private parlor of the Hays,
Mr. Will Walling left the young pair still over their dessert
and went out and called a cab and drove to Lincoln’s Inns
Fields to call on Messrs. Sothoron &#38; Drummond.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had been the solicitors of the Hays, of Haymore,
for many years, and were, of course, deeply interested in
all that concerned them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Much correspondence had already passed between the
London and New York firms, bearing on the recent appearance
of the undoubted lawful heir of Haymore in opposition
to the fraudulent pretender, so that there was already a
perfect understanding of the case established between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now a little after business hours, but Mr. Will
Walling felt sure that, having received his dispatch announcing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>his visit, one or both members of the firm would
remain at their office to receive him.</p>

<p class='c009'>In fact, he found both gentlemen there. The case was
considered much too important to admit of neglect or indifference,
and being after office hours, they were quite at
leisure to give their whole attention to the business in hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Walling spent four hours with Messrs. Sothoron &#38;
Drummond, and together the three gentlemen went through
the mass of documents, all together constituting indisputable,
immovable proof of Randolph Hay’s identity as the
only lawful heir of Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will not weary my reader with any of the lawyers’ talk,
but hasten on to its results.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was nearly nine o’clock when the three gentlemen, having
brought their interview to an end, left the office together
and separated, to seek their several destinations—Sothoron
to his home on Clapham Common, Drummond to his club
on Regent Street, and Walling to his friends at Morley’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Will found Ran and Judy seated at the front window
of their parlor, in which the gas had been turned down low
to enable them to see out into the street, for they were
gazing down on the panorama of the night scene on Trafalgar
Square.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!” exclaimed Mr. Will, as he entered the room,
flung his hat across the floor and dropped into a large easy-chair
near the two young people, “are you ready to set out
for Yorkshire and Haymore by the first mail train to-morrow
morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” inquired Ran, looking around,
rather startled by the abrupt entrance and action of his
lawyer, while Judy also wheeled her chair and raised her
eyes inquiringly to the first speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what I asked. Are you ready to start for Haymore
Hall by the first train to-morrow morning?” repeated
Mr. Will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the use of your asking that, Walling, when
you know there is ever such a law fight to go through first.
And even after I have won my suit, as of course I shall win
it, there must be writs of ejectment, and the Lord knows
what all, before we can get that villain out of my house:
for ‘possession is nine points of the law,’ you know, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>you may depend he will contest the tenth point to the bitter
end,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all!” heartily exclaimed Will Walling; “there
will be no fight. The fellow will not fight; he’ll fly. And
though ‘possession is nine points of the law,’ he has never
had possession. What do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think your words are more incomprehensible than
ever. I do not understand them in the least,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor do I,” added Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, listen, both of you. I have been three or
four or more hours closeted with Sothoron &#38; Drummond.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we have been over, together, all the documentary
proofs of your identity as Randolph Hay, the only lawful
heir of Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, every document connected with the case has your
name, that is, Randolph Hay, as the heir and now the owner
of Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you, and you only, are Randolph Hay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Undoubtedly. But there is another who has taken my
name and estates.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has taken your name and stolen and squandered a
good deal of your money during the last few months; there
is no doubt about that. Nor will you ever get a penny of
that lost money back; there is no hope of that. These
moneys he has obtained by fraud from your bailiff, John
Prowt, of Haymore, and from your family solicitors, Sothoron
&#38; Drummond, at Lincoln’s Inns Fields. But, my dear
sir, for all that, he has never been in possession of your
estate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, when——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he is not Randolph Hay, in whose name all the
documents are made out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he is at Haymore Hall now. And it will require a
legal process to get him out, for he will fight every inch of
the ground.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all! He is not at Haymore Hall, nor has he ever
been there. His fraudulent presence is not known there. If
he were there now, or ever had been there, or if his person
were known there under his stolen name of Randolph Hay,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>then, I grant you, in that case we might have to meet some
trouble and confusion, yet not much. And as it is, we shall
have no trouble at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But this is strange. How is it that he has never been
to Haymore?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, it seems, he prefers to squander the revenues
of the estate in Paris. But let me tell you what I have
this afternoon learned of the fellow from Messrs. Sothoron
&#38; Drummond.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, pray do,” said Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems, then, that when he first brought his—lady over
here, he intended to go to Haymore, and even had grand
preparations made there for their reception; but from some
caprice, he changed his mind and went to Paris, where he
has been with his—lady ever since, squandering money just
as if he knew it did not belong to him, and deferring his
return from time to time, and drawing large sums from—your
bankers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From what I know of Gentleman Geff, I should think it
hard to draw him from the saloons of Paris to the seclusion
of a Yorkshire country house,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but now it seems he is really coming with a party
of friends to spend Christmas at Haymore Hall. He has
sent down orders for the house to be prepared to receive
himself and—lady and guests by the fifteenth. Now then,
the servants at the Hall are preparing to receive Mr. and
Mrs. Randolph Hay, whom they have never seen. Now
you and your wife are Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what do you advise?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, man alive, your course is as plain as daylight.
You and your wife take the first train to-morrow and speed
to Yorkshire and to Haymore Hall, where you will arrive
early in the evening, where you will, no doubt, find everything
ready for you and be joyfully received by your servants.
To be sure, you will arrive rather earlier than you
were expected; but that will not matter much, especially as
it will give you time to get well rested before you will be
called upon to receive Gentleman Geff and his distinguished
party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that will be the most delicious fun!” exclaimed
Judy, clapping her hands with glee; “and we will have,
besides Ran and myself, Mike, Dandy and Longman all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>drawn up in a line to welcome him. He will think all
Grizzly Gulch has come to Haymore Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For his guilty soul it would seem</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'>“‘Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>said Will Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There would be an awful row,” exclaimed Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. There would be a surprise, a panic and a
flight. That is, if you let the villain go. I am not sure
that you ought not to have a warrant and an officer ready
to arrest him. Or rather, I am sure that you ought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would rather not, if he will leave quietly,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must make no terms with a criminal. That
would be ‘compounding a felony,’ a serious offense against
English law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, is it settled? Shall we go to-morrow morning?”
inquired Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear; certainly,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I will go down to the office and find a Bradshaw
and see about our train,” said Mr. Will, picking up his hat
and hurrying out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had scarcely disappeared when the door opened and
Mike, Dandy and Longman entered the parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy ran forward to welcome them, while Ran turned
up the gas.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have been sitting in the dark to watch the scene in
the square below,” Judy explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, boys, have you found comfortable quarters?” inquired
Ran, as soon as they were all seated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Illigant; and chape enough, too, be the same token, close
by in the Strand; a very ginteel, dooble-bidded bidroom.
Longman, being av a giant fit for a circus, do hev one bid
all to himsilf. And Dandy and me, being av little fellows,
do have the ithir to oursilves,” Mike explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>While they were still talking Mr. Will Walling returned
to the room with a Bradshaw in his hand. He greeted the
three visitors pleasantly, dropped into a chair and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there is a train that leaves Euston Square Station
at six in the morning and reaches Chuxton at three in the
afternoon. After that there is no other parliamentary train
until twelve noon, which would make it nine in the evening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>when it stops at Chuxton, and would be too late to go on
to Haymore the same night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, then, we will leave by the earlier train, if Judy has
no objection,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I? Why, I never minded getting up early!” exclaimed
Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say, boys?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sooner the better for us, sir,” replied Dandy, speaking
for the rest, who promptly assented.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, as the hour was late, the visitors bade good-night,
and the party left behind separated and retired to
rest, to be ready for their early rising.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='large'>AT HAYMORE HALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The whole party were up in the double darkness of a
London winter morning before sunrise. They dressed and
breakfasted by gaslight, and then entered a large carriage
and drove to Euston Square Railway Station, where they
were met by Mike, Dandy and Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Had you not better telegraph to your housekeeper before
we start to let her know that we shall certainly be at
Haymore to-night so that there may be no mistake, and
she will be sure to have beds aired, fires built and dinner
ready for us when we get there?” suggested Mr. Walling,
who was always directly on the lookout for his own personal
comforts, and, incidentally, for those of others.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran immediately acted on the suggestion, saying, when
he rejoined his friends after sending the dispatch:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will think the message comes from the other fellow
in Paris and that he is in London on his way to Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will think, or rather she will see, that the telegram
comes from Mr. Randolph Hay, and that will be enough,”
replied Mr. Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the other fellow comes on the fifteenth with his
friends and finds us in possession——Well! I can’t help
anticipating a rink, a circus, a hippodrome, a spectacular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>drama, an earthquake, a conflagration and the day of judgment
all rolled into one!” said Randolph, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And there will be nothing of the sort. Only at most a
panic and a total rout. Come, we must take our seats,” exclaimed
Will Walling, as he led the way to the waiting train,
where a guide showed them into the middle compartment
of a first-class carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike, Dandy and Longman had taken tickets for the
second class.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now is it not too bad that Ran cannot get our friends
in here with us, Mr. Walling?” demanded Judy, as she
settled herself in the luxurious corner front seat of their
compartment and noticed that there were just six seats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Judy,” muttered Ran, “your brother and his
companions are able to take these three vacant seats with
us if they please, but for prudential and very praiseworthy
reasons they choose to economize and take the second class.
I could not offer them a worse offense than invite them
to take these seats at my expense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I do think there is a great deal of false pride in
the world,” Judy pouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So there is, darling; but we cannot cure it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a wonder their high mightinesses consent to go
with you to Haymore and be your guests there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is a different affair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see that it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they do,” laughed Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train started, and the conversation dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was still in the darkness before day that they left the
station and sped off into the open country, where the world
was scarcely beginning to wake up. In London the world
seems never to go to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our three travelers had had but little rest in the last
twenty-four hours; and so, between the darkness of the
hour, the motion of the train and their own weariness, they
dozed off into dreamland, where they lingered some hours,
until they were called back by the sudden stopping of the
train, for an instant only, for before they were fully awake
it was off again, flying northward as if pursued by the
furies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy shook herself up and looked out of the window on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>her right hand to see the eastern horizon red with the coming
of the wintry sun above the moorland.</p>

<p class='c009'>At noon they reached Liverpool, where they left their
seats, got lunch and then changed their train for the Great
Northern for York.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late in the afternoon they entered the great cathedral
city, where again they left their seats, took tea and a little
later took train for Chuxton.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was nearly sunset when they came to the end of their
railway journey at the little market town.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no carriage waiting to take them to Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then it occurred to Ran for the first time that by
some strange oversight no carriage had been ordered by him
or his attorney to come from the Hall to meet them at the
station.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were several vehicles around the place, but all
seemed to be engaged by other parties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our friends walked together to the Tawny Lion Tavern,
where Ran ordered refreshment and inquired for a conveyance
to Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Tawny Lion boasted but one—a large carryall drawn
by two stout horses—but that was then engaged, and would
not be available to our travelers for perhaps two hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>These were passed by Ran and Judy, after they had finished
their meal, in sauntering about the quaint, old-fashioned
town and making acquaintance with its streets and
houses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s where we shall have to come to do our country
shopping, you know, darling,” said Ran; “for I have been
told that there is but one general shop at Haymore, where,
though they keep everything to sell, from a second-hand
pulpit to a soup dish, you can get nothing very good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I shall encourage the home trade, and deal at Haymore
all the same,” replied Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Mr. Will Walling spent his time of waiting
over the fire in the inn parlor, with a bottle of port wine
and a stack of cigars on the table beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Longman, accompanied by his shadows, Dandy and
Mike, walked out in the direction of the Old Heath Farm
to make inquiries about his mother, and, naturally, the
nearer he came to the scene of his boyhood’s home the keener
and the more intense became his anxiety. It had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>seemed to him that his buxom, healthy, hearty mother
could have sickened and died; nor had it seemed more than,
barely possible that she might have married again. He
rather hoped to find her where he had left her five years
before, living on the farm. Still, as he turned from the
Chuxton highroad and went into a narrow lane, overhung
by the branches of the leafless trees that grew on each side
the path leading to the farmhouse, all the dread possibilities
of life seemed to threaten him ahead. He could not now
speak of his feelings. He hurried on. The giant was as
weak as a child when he passed through the farm yard and
went up to the house. A man was approaching from another
direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman leaned against the side of the house for support
as he faltered forth a question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh?” demanded the farmer, looking fixedly at the
stranger, as if he suspected him of being top heavy through
too much drink. “Is it the Widow Longman ye’re asking
about? No, she dun not bide here now. She hasn’t been
here for these five years past.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another faint, almost inaudible question from the weak
giant, which the farmer had to bend his quick, sharp ear to
hear at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is she living, do you arsk? Oh, ay, she’s living good
enough. She’s keeping house for the parson at the rectory,
Haymore, about ten miles to the norrard of this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank the Lord!” ejaculated Longman, lifting his cap,
almost overcome by the sudden collapse of highly strung
nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, my man, what’s the matter with you? You
look to be used up! I thought it was drink when I first
saw you. But now I see it isn’t. You look to be faint for
want of drink, not heavy from too much of it. Come in
now and take a mug o’ beer, home brewed. ’Twill do ye
good,” urged the farmer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you. No, really. You are very kind, but
I must get on,” said Longman, rising, and now that his
tension of anxiety was relieved, gaining life with every
breath he drew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t wonder now if you was that son o’ hern who
went to sea long years ago and never was heerd on since?”
said the farmer, calling after him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“Yes, I am her son, and I am going to Haymore now to
find her. Thank you, and good-day to you,” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m dogged glad on it! One widdy’s heart will sing
for joy this night, anyhow! Well, good-day, and good
luck to you, my lad!” were the last words of the kind-hearted
farmer.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Longman rejoined his two friends, who he had left
waiting for him at the farm gate, his happy face told the
“glad tidings” before his tongue could speak them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hooray! It’s good news ye’re afther hearing!” cried
Mike, throwing up his cap and catching it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I thank the Lord!” replied Longman reverently.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, as they walked down the lane and out upon
the highroad leading to Chuxton, Longman told them all
that he had heard from the farmer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So she’s housekeeper at the rectory itself! That’s where
your niece, Miss Julia, will be at service, Mr. Quin!” exclaimed
Mike; “that is, if she’s not married,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or dead, poor wench!” sighed old Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, bother that! Nobody’s dead, or going to die just
yet, is there, Samson, man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope not, Mike.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyways, we shall hear when we get to Haymore. Yes,
that is so,” said Dandy, with an air of resignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not nearly so anxious to hear from his niece as
Longman had been to get news of his mother. He did not,
indeed, care much about her now, whatever he might come
to care after he should have renewed his acquaintance with
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached Chuxton and turned into the street
leading to the “Tawny Lion,” they saw the huge carryall
drawn up before the door, with a crowd of idlers, mostly
boys, gathered around it to see it start.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman and his companions went into the parlor, where
they found the Hays and Will Walling waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why have you stayed for us, Mr. Hay? This is really
too kind!” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kind to myself, friend! I did not want to go without
you. Even if I had, Judy would not have allowed it. I
see by your face that you have good news of your mother.
I congratulate you,” said Ran, offering his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, thank Heaven!” replied the hunter. And then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>in a few words, as they walked to the carryall, he told all
he heard at the farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is splendid!” exclaimed Judy with enthusiasm,
as she was lifted into the carryall by Ran and placed in the
sheltered back seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy must sit back there with you, darling. He is
old, and then the drive over the moor will be a very cold
one. You won’t mind it, will you, Judy?” he inquired, as
he settled her among the cushions and tucked her fur cloak
well around her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no, of course not. Especially if you will sit right
in front of me so I can lean my head forward on your
shoulder sometimes,” Judy replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ran helped Dandy in and made him sit by Judy.
The others followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Will Walling sat immediately in front of Judy
and Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike and Longman on the third seat forward. The
driver, a stout Yorkshireman, on the box.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strong draught horses started at a moderate pace,
such as might well be kept up during the whole journey
across the moor.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a dark, cold night, and the two glass lanterns,
fixtures, on each side above the driver’s seat, did little better
than make “darkness visible.” But the road was as safe
as a road by night could be, and the horses knew it as well
as they knew the way to their own cribs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two hours of jog trot, safe and steady driving brought
them to a great mass of dense shadows, like black mountains
and forests against a dark gray northern sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>The driver drew up his horses before this mystery and
announced that they had reached the great wall of Haymore
Park.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far from the lodge gates?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About half a mile, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drive on then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you please, Mr. Hay, I would like to leave the carryall
at the point nearest Haymore hamlet and rectory,” said
Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course! Of course! Naturally you must hasten first
of all to your dear mother. But remember, friend, you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>my guest at the Hall, and bring your mother also if you
can persuade her to come,” heartily responded Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, do, Mr. Longman. And I will go to see your
mother just as soon as ever I can,” warmly added Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you both very much,” replied Longman, but he
gave no promise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember, Longman, that you saved my life. But for
you—under the Divine Providence,” said Ran, reverently
lifting his hat, “I should not be here now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, nor I, either, for that matter,” added Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We both owe you a debt that we can never repay, Longman,”
said Ran, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never, except in love and gratitude. And we would
like to put ‘a body’ in our sentiments to make them ‘felt,’
Mr. Longman. You will come and stay with us at the
house, will you not?” pleaded Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You make too much of my service, a service that any
man worthy of the name would have done for any other.
I do not know what my plain old mother would say to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am plain myself,” said Judy; “a child of the people.
Less than that, for I never knew father or mother—a child
of the planet only! My only worth is being the wife of my
dear Ran here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam, you are the wife of Mr. Randolph Hay, of
Haymore. You are the lady of the manor. And in this
country a social abyss divides you and yours from me and
mine as deep, as impassable as that ‘great gulf’ that lay between
Dives and Lazarus,” said Longman solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not so! It shall not be so! I will not have it!
Nothing but the will of Heaven shall divide us from our
dear friends!” said Judy passionately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” added Ran with earnest emphasis. “No social
gulf shall separate us, Longman, dear old boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we be at the lodge gates, sir. And this is the
nearest point we pass to the rectory. We turn in here to go
by the elm avenue up to the Hall. And the road continues
right straight on under the park wall up to the rectory and
the church, which is on the other side of the road,” the
driver explained, drawing up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Longman, I should like you to go on to the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and dine with us, but I know it would be wrong to ask
you,” said Ran, as the hunter got up to leave the carryall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will see you early in the morning, sir,” said the giant.
And then he shook hands all around, jumped from the
carryall and strode on up the road to the rectory on that
visit to his mother which we have already described.</p>

<p class='c009'>A woman came out of the porter’s lodge on the right-hand
side, swung open both broad leaves of the gate and stood
courtesying as the carryall rolled through.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The old porter’s daughter—a worthy dame,” said the
driver, in answer to a question from Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>The carriage rolled on through an avenue shaded by great
oaks, whose branches, however, were now bare. In the
turns of this drive they caught glimpses of the house
through the trees, with lights sparkling here and there from
the many windows into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>After several sweeping turns the avenue passed in front
of the house, and the carriage drew up before a huge, oblong
gray building, with turrets at each corner, bay windows on
the first floor and balconies above.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the carriage stopped the hall door was flung wide,
and several men and women servants appeared in the
lighted hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The butler stood in the door. Two footmen came down
the steps to attend their master and mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran lifted Judy from the carriage, whispering:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Welcome home, my darling,” and led her up the steps
and into the hall, followed by his friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>The butler, with a low bow, made way for them to pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>The housekeeper, a very aged woman, dressed in a brown
satin gown and a lace cap, came forward to meet them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Welcome home, sir and madam. We have waited for
you long, and greet you gladly,” she said in a tone of exaggerated
reverence and with a deep courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran held out his frank hand, and Judy said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Mrs.—Mrs.——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Basset, madam, and been in the family all my life, as
mother and father were before me. Your old butler, sir,
is my son, getting older every day, but not yet past service,
either of us, I thank Heaven. Will you go to your room
now, madam?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Yes, if you please,” said Judy. “I would like to take
off my bonnet and cloak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Basset looked all around, and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think that your maid has come in yet. Shall
I send one of the men out to hurry her? I suppose she is
busy with the parcels in the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I—I—have no maid—yet,” replied Judy, blushing
deeply, for she was rather afraid of this fine ruin of an old-time
housekeeper, even though the aged woman was evidently
falling a little into her second childhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I see! I beg your pardon, ma’am. You will be
waiting to take some good girl from the estate. That has
been the way with the ladies of Hay from time immemorial.”
She paused suddenly in her babble and looked
fixedly, though still very respectfully, at Mr. Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Ran was just a little sensitive about his personal
appearance. He was not a handsome, soldierly blond, but
a beautiful, dark brunette; graceful as a leopard, sinuous
as a serpent. He was in the habit of humorously stigmatizing
himself as “a little nigger.” So when the aged housekeeper
regarded him with her wistful gaze, he thought she
was saying to herself, how little like he was to any of the
Hays. He laughed a little and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do not find much resemblance in me to my tall and
fair forefathers, Mrs. Basset.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir,” she replied solemnly, “you are the living image
of your honored grandmother.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man burst out laughing, and was joined by
Mike and Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But their mirth ceased as the aged housekeeper added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She died at twenty-three years old. She was the best,
the brightest and the most beautiful being that my eyes
ever beheld! And, yes, she died at twenty-three years old!
And you are her living image, as nearly as it is possible
for a gentleman to be. That was the reason why I looked
at you so, sir. I beg your pardon; I forgot myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t speak of it, Mrs. Basset,” said Ran kindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir. You can see the portrait in the picture
gallery to-morrow and judge for yourself—or even to-night
if you will,” said the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you; not to-night; we are too tired. To-morrow
you shall show us over the whole house, if you will.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“That I will with pride and pleasure, sir. And now,
madam, shall I attend you to your room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, yes, please,” said Judy; and she followed
her conductress up the broad staircase to a vast upper hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The housekeeper opened a door near the head of the
stairs and admitted her charge into a spacious, sumptuous
bedchamber, upholstered in ebony and old gold, and in
which burned a fine open coal fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>The aged woman, much against Judy’s will, insisted upon
waiting upon her; took off her heavy cloak and hat and
hung them in the wardrobe, drew a luxurious easy-chair to
the fire and seated her in it, and hovered around her with
affectionate attentions until Mr. Hay came in, when, with
one of her quaint courtesies, she withdrew from the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Ran took Judy in his arms, folded her to his heart,
kissed her fondly and welcomed her home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to-morrow, my darling, we shall have to prepare
to welcome Gentleman Geff and his—lady. I shall send in
the morning for Mr. Campbell and his daughter, that the
villain may be confronted with his wronged wife, as well as
his betrayed friend,” said Ran, as he gave his arm to Judy
to take her down to the dining-room, where dinner waited.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX<br> <span class='large'>WAITING THE ISSUE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the morning Ran and Judy woke up to look, for the
first time, by daylight on their new home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran opened the windows and let in the light of the
December day upon their bedchamber, a vast, peaceful,
slumberous room, upholstered throughout in olive green
and gold, and looking out upon a park, full of sunny glades
and shady groves, even now in winter when the light of day
shone down on burnished dry grass in the glades and evergreen
trees in the groves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young couple, though lord and lady of the Manor
of Haymore, had as yet neither valet nor maid. So Ran
rang no bell, but from a hodful of coal at the chimney
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>corner, with his own hand, replenished the fire in the grate
and then went to make his toilet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy lay still, with her eyes looking through the large
windows on two sides of the spacious chamber, out upon the
sunny and shady park until Ran had finished dressing and
left the room. Then she arose and took her bath and opened
her large sea trunk to find a dress suitable for her morning
wear.</p>

<p class='c009'>She finally selected a plain suit of dark gray velveteen,
with crimped linen ruffles at the throat and wrists. She
put it on and went downstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the hall below she found the wide doors open in front,
admitting the winter sunshine, and a great coal fire burning
in the broad fireplace in the back; and between the two,
near the front of the stairs, Ran, Will Walling, Mike and
Dandy standing in conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy was the spokesman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did think,” he was saying, “that Longman would
have come back last night to bring me news of Julie. But,
Lord, I do suppose he got so wrapped up into his mother
that he clean forgot me and mine, or else, maybe, he could
not well get away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was it, Dandy,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Same time, if, as how I had thought it might be so,
myself would have gone to the rectory with him. And ’deed
I’d agone, anyhow, only I didn’t like to be intruding into
a strange place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t understand,” said Will Walling, speaking for the
first time, “how you fortune-seekers can bear to stay away
for years from your native country without hearing a word
from any of your friends at home, and then, when you make
up your mind to return, and once set foot in your native
land, you straightway get into a fever of anxiety and impatience
to meet them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No more do I, but so it is!” confessed Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis,” added Mike. “Sure it was the very same wid
Mister Longman himself when he was gitting nigh onto the
ould farrum where he left his mother. It is curious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, if I only knowed she were alive and well,”
said Dandy apologetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you may be sure of that,” cheerfully exclaimed Ran,
“but I don’t think she is at the rectory.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“Why don’t you then, sir?” inquired Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because if she had been Longman would have seen her
and told her about you, and she would certainly have run
over last night or early this morning to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So she would! So she would! And yet I dunno—I
dunno! Even darters in these days ain’t none too dutiful
to feythers, let alone nieces to uncles, ’specially when they’ve
been parted twenty years,” said Dandy, shaking his bald
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think she is at the rectory, or, under the circumstances,
she would have run over here to see you,” said
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dunno! I dunno!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is most likely she is married and away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or dead and buried, poor wench,” sighed Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come, don’t be so downhearted. Longman will
be here soon. He promised to come early this morning,
and no doubt he will bring good news of your niece. Now
here is Judy, and we will go in to our breakfast,” concluded
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy, stepping from the bottom stair to the hall floor,
greeted Will Walling, Mike and Dandy with a cordial good-morning
and led the way to the breakfast room.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was just under the bedchamber Judy had left, and
had the same outlook from windows on the east and north
of sunny glades, of burnished dry grass and shady groves
of Scotch firs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The table was laid for five, and the old butler was in attendance;
not that His Importance, Mr. Basset, the butler,
ever waited at any other meal except dinner, and then only
at the sideboard; but on this particular occasion of the first
breakfast of the bridal pair at Haymore he thought proper
to volunteer his attendance in their honor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The consequence was that Mike, Dandy and even Judy
were almost afraid to speak, lest they should expose their
ignorance of high life to this imposing personage.</p>

<p class='c009'>The five sat down to table under the cloud of the butler’s
greatness.</p>

<p class='c009'>But soon the fragrant Mocha, the luscious waffles and the
savory venison steaks and other appetizing edibles combined
to dispel the gloom and enliven their spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>After breakfast Judy sent for the housekeeper, and
claimed her promise to show them through the building.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Basset was only too willing to oblige. The five
friends, led by their conductress, went first up the grand
staircase that led from the lower to the upper halls on every
floor to the top of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We had better go to the top first, ma’am, while we are
fresh, else we might find the stairs hard to climb,” said
Mrs. Basset.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Judy, as she knew that the old woman spoke chiefly
in the interests of her own infirmities, answered promptly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know best, Mrs. Basset. Suit yourself, and you
will suit us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They went upstairs to the low-ceiled rooms under the
roof, which Mrs. Basset described as servants’ bedrooms—storerooms
for furniture out of season, boxes, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then to the next below, all extra bedrooms, and to the
next below that, all family suites of apartments; and down
to the next, on which were the long drawing and the ballroom,
which, with the broad hall between them, took up
the whole flat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lastly, they came down to the first floor, on which were
the long dining-room, the breakfast room, the parlor, the
library and the picture gallery, which was the last place
to be inspected.</p>

<p class='c009'>The family portraits were arranged in chronological order,
beginning with the Saxon ancestor of the eighth century,
who, with rudest arms and in rudest clothing, resisted
the first invasion of the Danes, and whose “counterfeit presentment”
here was probably but the work of the rough
artist’s imagination, executed, or rather perpetrated, at a
much later date.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then in regular order came the barons who had rallied
around Hereward in his last desperate stand against the
usurper, William of Normandy; the iron-clad knights who
had followed Richard of the Lion heart to the Holy Land;
the barons who had taken up arms in support of the House
of York against that of Lancaster; the plumed cavaliers
who had insanely flocked with all their retainers to the
standard of the Stuarts in every mad attempt of that unhappy
family to regain their lost throne; periwig-pated
courtiers of the Georgian dynasty; and, lastly, the swallowtail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>coated and patent leather booted gentlemen of the Victorian
age, as represented by the late squire and his three
sons.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ladies of the chiefs were all there, too, each by the
side of her “lord,” and dressed in costume of her time, or
in what was supposed to be such, for there is little doubt
that many of the earlier portraits were merely fancy pictures.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the group of the late squire and his family Judy
suddenly caught her breath and clasped her hands and stood
stock-still, gazing on the full-length picture of a beautiful
dark girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is like, isn’t it now, ma’am?” inquired the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like! Why, the picture might be taken for his portrait
if it were not for the dress!” exclaimed Judy, gazing at her
husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is still more like my Cousin Palma,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, so it is,” assented Judy; “and does not need
change of dress to make it perfect. The hair of that lady
in the picture is worn exactly as Palma wears hers, and
that costume of dark blue is not unlike the dress Palma
wore to our wedding in color and make.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is indeed a wonderful likeness to Mrs. Stuart,” remarked
Mr. Walling. “Who is the lady?” he demanded,
turning to the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The last Mrs. Hay, of Haymore, the grandmother of
the young squire here. She died at the age of twenty-three,
leaving three boys, of one, two and three years of
age—to give the figures in round numbers,” replied Mrs.
Basset.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know she was the wife of the late squire; but
whose daughter was she?” persisted Will Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>The housekeeper was silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Faix, Misther Walling, is it in the coorthoose ye are,
with Misthress Basset intil the witness box, that ye would
be cross-examining herself?” demanded Mike.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Walling turned a deprecating, apologetic glance
upon Ran, who quietly replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was the daughter of a gypsy chief. Her name was
Gentyl Tuinquer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” exclaimed Mr. Will. Then, feeling rather uncomfortable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>he added, to cover his confusion. “How beautiful
she must have been!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how much more beautiful she must be now!” exclaimed
Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawyer stared at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Up there in heaven, I mean; for, of course, she is in
heaven, for you may see by her face how good she is,” added
Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The housekeeper sighed. All the ladies of the long line
of Hays had been “angel born” before this gypsy girl from
the tents came into the family. And though the woman
could not help loving the memory of the lovely young creature,
she equally could not help suffering in her own pride
at any mention of the gypsy birth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran kissed the hand of the pictured lady and then turned
with his party to leave the gallery.</p>

<p class='c009'>On stepping out into the hall a footman met him, and
with a respectful salute said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you please, sir, there is—a—person waiting to see
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A person? Who? What sort of a person?” demanded
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A foreign-looking tall man, sir; might be a Patagonian,
only he can speak English.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Show him in here.” And with these words Ran crossed
the hall and entered a morning parlor on the same floor.
Then looking back he saw that, though his footman had
gone on his errand, his friends lingered in the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in, all of you. It is only Longman. You will
all want to see him, especially will Mr. Quin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do want to see him. Yes, that is so,” assented Dandy,
as they all followed Ran into the parlor, where they found
quite a variety of comfortable chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were scarcely seated when Longman entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran sprang up and met him; but Dandy pushed between
them, his round, bald head, as well as his face, glowing red
with excitement as he demanded:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you seen my Juley? Is she well and happy? Is
she still in the service of the minister?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is well and happy, but no longer in service anywhere.
She is married to John Legg, the greengrocer of
your native village, Medge. So I have not had the pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of making her acquaintance,” Longman replied, with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord above us! Well, I did sort of hope she was an
old-maid woman as would have been a housekeeper and a
daughter to myself in my old days. Well, and now she is
married, and, I do dare say, with a baker’s dozen of children.
Yes, that is so,” said Dandy, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but it isn’t so. She only married a few months ago,
when she was over forty years old, and John Legg, the
widower, who took her for his second wife, over fifty; so
she has no baker’s dozen of children as yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’s warrant he has a house full o’ young uns for
her to be stepmother to! And that will be a heap worse
than if the wench had a score of her own! It is as bad as
if I had found her dead! Yes, that is so,” sighed Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it isn’t so. You are all out again. John Legg has
no children at home. He has a son and daughter, and gave
them both a grand education above his means, and to repay
him they did all they could to break his heart. They had
worldly ambitions above their state, and despised the calling
of their father. The son took ‘holy orders,’ not for the love
of the Lord or the neighbor, but for love of self and the
world. He became a professional preacher only, not a minister
of religion. Mr. Hay,” said the speaker, suddenly
turning toward Ran, “I shall presently have something to
say to you in reference to this man, in which you have an
especial interest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Longman. I will remember to remind you
of it,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now will you please go on telling me about the family
my niece married into?” said Dandy impatiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly!” smiled Longman, good-humoredly. “The
son utterly ignores his father and hangs on the skirts of
influential people; but as yet has had but little success.
The daughter went out as a governess, less it seems to be
of service to children than to seek her own fortune, through
her beauty, among the rich and noble. She also ignores
her father. Both these hopefuls are ‘married and settled,’
to use the common phrase. And the newly-wedded, middle-aged
couple are alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what could have tempted my gal to agone and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>married of a old widdyman, whose son and darter had
showed sich bad blood?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, to get out of service, perhaps; to have a house
and home and a good husband, whom she could love, in
this John Legg.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t memorize the name of no John Legg at Medge,
though, to be sure, I have been away from them parts for
twenty years—yes, that is so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you can’t remember him. He was not a Medge
man. He came from the borough in London about two
years ago. After his wife died, broken-hearted, it is said,
by the conduct of his children, he sold out his business in
London and came down to Medge, where he had a married
sister and many nieces and nephews, his only relatives, except
his undutiful son and daughter. He had enough to
live on in retirement, but could not enjoy himself in idleness.
So he took the first chance to go into business again.
It happened that the only greengrocer in the place, an aged
man, wanted to sell out and go to live with his married
daughter, who was the wife of a farmer in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“More fool he!” exclaimed Dandy. “I saw the play of
‘Lear’ once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there was a <em>Cordelia</em> in it, you know, Dandy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“John Legg bought out the old greengrocer, shop, stock,
house, furniture and good will. The rectory people dealt
with him, as why not when he was the only greengrocer in
the village? And so he made the acquaintance of their
servant, Julia Quin, and soon proposed to marry her, and
as she did not wish to leave Medge and go with the rector
and his wife to Haymore, she accepted honest John Legg.
And I hear that they make a very comfortable couple.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know all this here you are a-telling me of
so confident like?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because in your interests I made very minute inquiries
into all the circumstances, and Mr. Campbell was so good as
to give me all the particulars,” replied Longman. “And,
Dandy, will you let me speak to my other friends—they
are waiting, you see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sartinly, Mr. Longman. Who’s a-hindering on you?
I myself am going into the town to send a telescope message
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to my niece,” replied the old man, and with a low bow,
intended for all the company, he turned and left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran hastily shook hands with Longman, then leaving
him with the others, hurried out after his old friend, whom
he found on the drive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy! Dandy, I say! Please stop!” he called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr. Hay, what’s your will, sir?” the old fellow
demanded, turning to face his host.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must not walk into the village. Take the dogcart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind, Mr. Hay, sir; but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will have my way. Come down with me to the stables.
I have not seen them yet. But I know there is a dogcart,
because Mr. Walling, who is always wide awake, took a
drive in it this morning to get an appetite for his breakfast
before we were up,” said Ran, as he turned into a footpath
leading through the grounds to the rear of the hall, far behind
which were the stables.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy followed him, if the truth is to be told, not unwilling
to spare his old limbs by riding instead of walking
to the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stable yard occupied full a square quarter acre of
ground, walled in by massive stone buildings, consisting of
stables proper, carriage houses, harness rooms, coachman’s
and groom’s quarters and kennels.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was full of activity on this morning; for all the fourlegged
creatures there, horses and hounds, seemed spoiling
for a run, and were venting their impatience of restraint—the
horses by neighing and kicking and the hounds by howling
and scratching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yo’ ought to have a good hunting party of gentlemen
down here for a few weeks, sir, to take the devil out of the
brutes,” said the old head groom, touching his hat to his
master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All in good time—a——Tell me your name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hobbs, sir, at your sarvice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Hobbs, if you have a steady-going horse, have
him put to a dogcart, and find a careful boy to drive Mr.
Quin to the village.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. Old Dick will be the hoss and Young Sandy
the driver. I’ll go and give the order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The groom went across the yard on his errand, while Ran
and Dandy walked off to the kennels to look at the dogs.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Not one on ’em to be compared to your Tip or my Lion,
Mr. Hay, in my poor opinion!” said Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These cannot excel ours in courage, or affection, or
fidelity, I am sure,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>And both men gave deep sighs to the memory of the faithful
creatures they had been compelled by circumstances to
leave behind them at the fort, where, it is true, the two dogs
were sure of the kindest treatment from their new owners—Surgeon
Hill, who had adopted Tip, and Adjutant Rose,
who had taken Lion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think we will ever see them again, Mr. Hay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do. In this world or the next.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The next! Mr. Hay, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? I believe the creature that once lives, lives
forever. Especially the creature capable of love, courage,
fidelity and self-sacrifice, as so many of the quadrupeds are,
must be immortal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What Dandy would have said in reply was arrested on his
lips by the approach of the dogcart, driven by one of the
under-grooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran helped his old friend upon the seat, tucked the rug
well over his knees and then inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where do you wish to go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the telescope office in the village.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drive this gentleman to the telegraph office,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beg pardon, sir; but there is no telegraph office in the
village, and none nearer than Chuxton,” said the young
groom, touching his hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Chuxton is ten miles off! Where we left the train
last night you know, Mr. Quin,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know! Well, let him drive me there, then! That
is if you can spare the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I can! All day, if you want it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Cause, you see, I don’t feel aquil to traveling all the
way back to the south of England, after having come all
the way up to the north, and I do want to see my niece very
bad. And I mean to send a telescope as will be sartin to
fetch her. Yes, that is so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then. Drive to Chuxton telegraph office, and
then wherever Mr. Quin wishes to go. You are at his
orders.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>The boy took the reins and drove off, and Ran turned
again to question the old groom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has there been much sport about here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None at all, sir. Since the young squire were killed, the
old squire never had no heart for nothing as long as he
lived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! How are the preserves?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir, the game is increasing and multiplying to
that degree for the want of sporting gents among ’em to
thin ’em out, that for once in a way poachers is a blessing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poachers! Why, what is the gamekeeper about, to permit
poachers to trespass?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir, there ain’t no gamekeeper here, nor likewise
been none since the old squire died. The last gamekeeper
went off to Australia to seek his fortune.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank Heaven!” breathed Ran with fervency, not loud
but deep, that now he could put his friend in office without
hurting any one’s feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, it was this a way, sir. When Kirby went to
foreign parts, the old squire was too ill to be bothered about
his successor, and after he died the place was left without
one. But surely, sir, Mr. Prowt wrote to you about all
these matters, for he sartinly told me as you had wrote back
how you would wait till you come down here in person to
see the place before you would appoint aither gamekeeper
or coachman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! has the coachman gone too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely, sir, Mr. Prowt wrote and told you that, too! He
left to better himself, so he said—took sarvice along of the
Duke of Ambleton.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What wages do you get as groom here, Hobbs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Head groom, sir, and twenty pund a year and my keep,
and bin in the famberly, man and boy, fifty years, and hope
to continuate in it for fifty more, I was gwine to say, but
anyways as long as I can work, and that will be as long as I
live, for I’d scorn to retire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excellent, Hobbs. Have you a family?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wife, sir, keeping house for me in the cottage there,”
said the old man, pointing to a little stone cottage built in
the wall next the stable, “and one son, sir—boy that driv
the dogcart. Steady lad, sir, though his feyther says it; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>one darter, sir, upper housemaid at the Hall—good girl,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are blessed in your family, Hobbs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks be to Heaven, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, you said your wages as head groom were
twenty pound a year. How much did the coachman get?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just twice as much, sir, forty pound a year, and a good
sound house over his head, and his livery and his beer. And
left all that, sir, for ten pund more, and gold lace on his
coat, and the honor of driving a duke. May the de’il fly
away with him!—begging your pardon, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mention it,” laughed Ran. “But you would not
have left Haymore under the same circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me!—why, sir, I never had the chance, so what would
be the use of boasting? But, indeed, I don’t think I would.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hobbs, can you drive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None better in the world, sir, though I say it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you shall be my coachman at the same wages that
your predecessor now gets from his new master,” said Ran,
smiling benignly down on the stupefied face of the man
before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, sir! sir! but this is too much, too much for poor
me! Such a permotion as to be coachman! I can hardly
believe it, sir! I can’t, indeed! And at a rise of wages,
too! I can’t hardly believe it!” droned Hobbs, fairly dazed
by his good fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go and tell your wife, then. And begin to see about
your livery, and fix up the coachman’s cottage—at my cost,
Hobbs. All that will help you to believe it. Good-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words the gracious young master left the
stable yard and walked back to the Hall, happy in the feeling
of having made others so, yet grave and thoughtful in
the recognition of his responsibilities for all who were dependent
on him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XX<br> <span class='large'>THE NEW RECTOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When Ran entered the morning room, where he had left
his friends, he found them all there, but now gathered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>a wide circle around the glowing sea coal fire in the large
open grate, listening to Longman, who was giving a detailed
account of his visit to the rectory and his evening with his
mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran drew a chair, sat down among them and made one
of the audience.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the speaker had finished his story Ran turned to
him and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Longman, if you are ready you may tell me what
you meant when you said that you had something to report
in reference to that undutiful son of worthy John Legg,”
said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. He has taken ‘holy orders,’ the more effectually
to serve the devil, I fear. And he has been appointed
by his brother-in-law to the living of Haymore parish,
worth six hundred pounds, besides the rectory and glebe—all
of which is in your gift, Mr. Hay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed! And who the mischief is the gentleman’s
brother-in-law?” demanded Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who but the fraudulent claimant of Haymore? Gentleman
Geff, or whatever his real name may be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” exclaimed Ran, drawing his breath hard. “The
plot seems to thicken! So the deceived wife of our Gentleman
Geff, the young lady upon whom we have all wasted
so much sympathy, is really no other than the pretty adventuress
who left her father to seek her fortune! But I
think we heard of her as Lamia Leegh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Longman, “it would appear that when
brother and sister left honest John Legg, their shopkeeping
father, they must have changed the spelling of their names
from plain Legg to mystic Leegh. The latter has a more
aristocratic sound, you know. At any rate, their name was
Legg; yet you heard of the girl as Leegh, and certainly the
letter of the man to Mr. Campbell was signed Leegh—Cassius
Leegh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did the fellow write to Mr. Campbell about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, to warn him to leave the rectory, as he himself had
been appointed to the living and should enter upon his office
in January, after which he should not require the assistance
of a curate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed!” again exclaimed Ran. “I think the fraudulent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>claimant is giving away the Haymore patronage in a
very reckless way!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us see now how the case stands. The plot thickens
so fast that it requires a little clearing. The Rev. Mr.
Campbell was called to Haymore to fill the pulpit of the
late Dr. Orton during the absence of the latter at Cannes,
and remains in the office at a low salary until a rector is
appointed to the living. And my substitute, the fraudulent
claimant, has appointed his unworthy brother-in-law, who
has warned the good curate to leave. Have I stated the
case correctly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite so,” said Will Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then. And we expect the three worthies,
Gentleman Geff, Miss Legg and the Rev. Mr. Legg, calling
themselves Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay and the Rev. Cassius
Leegh, all in full feather, here this evening! We must
be prepared for them. Gentleman Geff must be confronted
with the wife he deserted and the friend he assassinated.
Oh, that Miss Legg might be met by her forsaken father!
That is barely possible if John Legg should take the train
for Chuxton immediately on the receipt of Dandy’s telegram,
and come with his wife! And the Rev. Mr. Leegh
shall be received by—the rector of Haymore! But that last
item necessitates prompt action. Longman, come into the
library with me, will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The hunter arose and followed Ran upstairs and into the
library, where they sat down at a table on which stood pen,
ink and paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Longman,” said Ran, “would it suit you to be gamekeeper
of Haymore?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mr. Hay, it would make me the happiest man on
earth! But I really would not wish you to give me the
place at another man’s expense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never fear; it will be at no man’s expense in the sense
you mean. There has been no gamekeeper at Haymore for
a year past. The last one left to seek his fortune in Australia,
and no successor has yet been appointed. The place
is yours if you will have it. Indeed, you would please me
much by taking it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, then, I will take it, sir, with many thanks,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>exclaimed the hunter warmly, his whole face glowing with
the sincere delight he felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that is settled. Get the keys from the bailiff and
examine the cottage and have it fitted up for yourself and
your mother in the most comfortable manner and send the
bills to the bailiff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will, Mr. Hay. You have made me very happy, for
my mother’s sake as well as my own. We both owe you
hearty thanks!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t speak of thanks again, Longman. The man who
saved my life can never owe me thanks for anything that I
may have the happiness of doing for him. Now to speak
of another matter. Will you kindly take a letter for me to
the Rev. Mr. Campbell?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, sir, with great pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take a book, then, or amuse yourself in any way you
please, while I write it,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman arose and roamed about before the bookcases,
reading the titles of the imprisoned volumes until he was
tired of the amusement. None of the books attracted him.
He was not a bookman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have finished my letter now, Longman, if you are
ready to take it,” said Ran, folding and sealing the note in
which he had invited Mr. Campbell to come with his wife
and daughter to dine with himself and Mrs. Hay that evening
and confer about the reverend gentleman’s appointment
to the living of Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am quite ready, sir,” said Longman, and he took the
letter and put it in his breast pocket and left the library.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had scarcely gone when a footman entered and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you please, sir, the bailiff, Mr. Prowt, is here, asking
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let him come in here,” said Ran with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later the bailiff entered, took off his hat, bowed
profoundly to the young squire, and stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take a seat, Mr. Prowt, if you please. You wished to
see me, I am told,” said Ran pleasantly, though hardly able
to control the smile that lurked in the corners of his eyes
and lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” replied the bailiff, sitting down and placing
his hat on the floor between his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” inquired Ran after an awkward pause.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Well, squire, if there is anything amiss I hope you will
excuse it. I really did not expect you down last evening,
and made no preparations to meet you. I am told by the
head groom that there was no carriage sent to the station at
Chuxton.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does not matter in the least, Mr. Prowt,” said Ran
with a boyish twinkle in his eyes that he could not suppress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, begging your pardon, squire, but it matters
very much. I wish to set myself right with you, sir. I wish
to tell you that it was all the neglect and carelessness of
them telegraph people in Chuxton not forwarding your dispatch
in time. You must, in course, sent it yesterday morning
to announce your arrival in the evening, but I never got
it until this blessed morning, when I thought that it was
this evening you were coming. And I did not know any
better until I came over here and stopped at the stable to
tell Hobbs to be sure to send the chariot to meet you. And
he told me that you were already here—that you had arrived
last night. I don’t think I ever was so knocked over
in my life. And no one to meet you! And no ceremonies
befitting the reception of the Squire of Haymore and his
bride!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is all right. Don’t trouble yourself,” said Ran, now
laughing outright. “Come and dine with me this evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Prowt stared for a moment before answering. Never in
the memory of man had a bailiff been invited to dine with a
squire of Haymore. Then he reflected that the young heir
had been found in America, and that America was a very
democratic and republican part of the world, and that would
account for the free and easy ways of the new squire. Only
the bailiff was afraid Mr. Hay might be going to ask the
butler and the head groom to dine with him, also; and that
the bailiff could not stand. If he had never dined with the
squire, neither had he ever dined with butler or groom.
While he hesitated, Ran, misunderstanding his perplexity,
said kindly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“An informal dinner, Prowt. Only the clergyman and
his wife and daughter, my solicitor, my brother-in-law, two
friends from America, Mrs. Hay and myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Prowt drew a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir,” he said. “You do me great honor.
When shall I bring my books for your examination?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Not this week, Prowt. This is Thursday. No business
until Monday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as you please, sir,” said the bailiff, picking up his
hat and rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>And without more words he bowed himself out of the
library.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran went downstairs and rejoined his friends in the
morning room, and entertained them with an account of his
interview with the bailiff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My chief reason for asking him to dinner,” concluded
the young man, “was that he might be present this evening
to assist us in receiving Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman Geff and
their esteemed brother and brother-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment the luncheon bell rang, and the whole
party went across the hall to the small dining-room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI<br> <span class='large'>TWO SCENES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Could any member of the party gathered at Haymore
Hall have been gifted with clairvoyance, he or she might
have witnessed in succession two scenes on that morning of
December the 15th, distant, indeed, in space, but near in
interest to the household.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first scene was in a greengrocer’s shop in Holly
Street, Medge.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tall, spare, gray-haired and grave-looking man, of fifty
years or upward, stood behind his counter waiting for
morning customers, for it was still early.</p>

<p class='c009'>A blue-coated telegraph boy hurried in, put a blue envelope
in his hand, and laid an open book on the counter,
saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“A dispatch, Mr. Legg; please sign.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The astonished John Legg, who had never received a
telegram in the half century of his whole life, and now
feared that this one must herald some well-merited misfortune
to his unloving and undutiful but beloved son or
daughter, nervously scrawled his name in the boy’s book
and tore open the envelope and read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“<span class='sc'>Haymore, Chuxton, Yorkshire</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>December 15, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>To Mr. John Legg</span>, Medge, Hantz: I have just come
from America; want to see my niece; am not able to travel.
Let her come to me immediately. It will be to her advantage.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Andrew Quin.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>With a gasp of relief that this message was no herald of
misfortune, but rather possibly of good fortune, honest John
hurried with it into the back parlor, where his wife—a red-cheeked,
blue-eyed, brown-haired, buxom woman of forty or
more—sat sewing, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, Juley! Read this! What does it mean? Who is
Andrew Quin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he thrust the dispatch into her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes devoured it, and then she answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, it is from my dear old Uncle Dandy. He went
out to the gold fields in California about twenty years ago,
and we have never heard from him since. And now he has
just come back, and rich as Croesus, of course! And I am
the only relation he has in the whole world! And he wants
to see me. And he isn’t able to travel. And he may be at
death’s door, poor, dear old fellow. John Legg, when does
the next northbound train stop here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I believe there’s a parliamentary stops here at—let
me see—nine o’clock,” answered the greengrocer, slowly
collecting his ideas, that had been scattered by the intense
excitement of his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we must go by it!” exclaimed Mrs. Legg, jumping
to her feet and beginning immediately to lock up cupboards
and set back chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” cried John Legg, aghast at this impetuosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must go by it, or he may be dead before we get
there, and his hospital left to fortunes!” exclaimed Julia in
such trepidation that she reversed her words and never perceived
that she did so, nor, in his bewilderment, did John.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we haven’t half an hour to get ready in!” he
pleaded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must get ready in less time!” cried Mrs. Legg,
turning to run up the stairs that led from one corner of
the back room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’ll I do about the shop?” called John in dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Leave it to the boy a day or two,” replied Julia from
the head of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything will go to rack and ruin!” cried the greengrocer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“John Legg!” demanded his wife, rushing down the
stairs fully equipped for the journey with bonnet and big
shawl, an umbrella and bag in hand—“do you mean for the
sake of a paltry, two-penny-ha’-penny shop, not worth fifty
pounds, to risk an immense fortune, that will make you a
millionaire, or a silver or a gold king, or a brown answer
(bonanza?), or something of the sort?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,’ my dear,”
said the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jedehiah Judkins, come here and bring your master’s
overcoat! And, Jed, do you mind the shop well while we
are gone, and get Widow Willet’s Bob to come and help
you, and I’ll pay him and give you half a sovereign if we
find all right when we come back Saturday night,” said
Mrs. Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy, who had just come in with his empty basket
from delivering vegetables about the town, hastened with
big eyes into the back room to obey his mistress’ orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg submitted. He always did. Julia went about
fastening doors and windows, and lastly raking out and
covering up the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then leaving only the key of the front door with “the
boy,” the pair left the house and hurried to the station,
where they were just in time to buy their tickets and jump
into a second-class carriage. And before John Legg had
time to recover his routed and dispersed mental faculties
they were whirled halfway to London.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are the most energetic woman I ever saw in my
life, Julia!” he said, trying to understand the situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Need to be when there is a brown answer fortune, and
a silver kingdom, if not a gold one, in the question—yes,
and a dear, dying uncle, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if the boy will remember to take that celery to
the vicarage when the market gardener brings it this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, bother the celery, and the vicar, too! Think of the
silver and gold kingdom—and—yes, of course, the poor,
dear, dying uncle!” said Julia. And onward they flew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>northward toward Yorkshire, unconscious that they were
destined to take a part in a very memorable drama to be
enacted at Haymore Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other scene connected with the same drama, and
which the clairvoyant might have looked in upon, was the
elegant private parlor at Langham’s Hotel, where the counterfeit
Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay and the Rev. Mr.
Cassius Leegh sat at an early breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>The personal appearance of Gentleman Geff and his
“lady” are familiar to our readers. That of the Rev. Cassius
Leegh may be described. He resembled his sister.
Nature had given him a very handsome form and face, but
sin had marred both.</p>

<p class='c009'>On this morning both men looked bad; their faces were
pallid, their eyes red, their hands shaky, their voices husky,
their nerves “shattered,” their tempers—infernal!</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff had plunged into the gulf of dissipation
to drown remorse. And the last two months of lawless
deviltry in the French capital had made of him a mental
and physical wreck.</p>

<p class='c009'>His “reverend” brother-in-law was not far above him in
the path that leads down to perdition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gentleman Geff was as well as serene, and as beautiful
as it was possible for her to be under her adverse circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>But then, being the woman that she was, she had much
to console her. She had come from Paris enriched with
Indian shawls, velvet and satin dresses, laces and jewels
which might have been the envy of a duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>She wore her traveling suit of navy-blue poplin, for they
were to take an early train for Yorkshire immediately after
breakfast. She performed her duties as hostess at breakfast
with perfect self-possession, though often under great
provocation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you are settled at the rectory you will, of course,
bring down Mrs. Leegh and the children. I am quite longing
to make the acquaintance of my sweet sister-in-law and
her little ones,” said Lamia softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” sulkily replied her brother. “It’s a bad
time—in midwinter—to move children from the mild climate
of Somerset to the severe one of York.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here!” angrily and despotically exclaimed Gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Geff. “I won’t have it! You’ve got to bring ’em,
climate or no climate, or you’re no parson for my parish!
It was well enough when you were rollicking and carousing
’round Paris to leave your wife and kids with your father-in-law
in Somerset, but when you’re settled in Haymore
rectory you have got to have ’em with you. It would be
deuced disreputable to have you, the pastor of a parish,
living in one place and your wife and children in another.
And I don’t want any reverend reprobates around me, I can
tell you that much!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall have no cause to complain, Mr. Hay,” replied
Cassius Leegh, controlling his temper and speaking coolly,
though his blood was boiling with rage at the insult, for
which he would have liked to knock his “patron” down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it is time to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff arose, muttering curses at all and sundry
persons and things, flung his pocketbook at Mr. Leegh and
told him to go down to the office and settle the bill and
order a cab.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half an hour later Gentleman Geff and his companions
were seated in a compartment of a first-class carriage, flying
northward as fast as the mail train could carry them.</p>

<p class='c009'>My gentleman’s valet and my lady’s maid traveled by the
second class of the same train.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff made himself as disagreeable to his fellow
travelers as shattered nerves and bad temper could drive him
to be, and as the hours passed he became so unendurable as
to tax to the utmost the forbearance of his victims, who rejoiced
when the day of torture drew to a close and their
train steamed into the station at Chuxton and stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all go out and stood on the platform. The train
started again and steamed northward. Gentleman Geff
looked around for his state carriage and four. There was
none visible. He began to curse and swear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come into the waiting-room, dearest,” said Lamia
sweetly. “No doubt your carriage will be here in a few
moments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It should be here now, waiting. I’ll be —— ——!”
(with a terrible oath) “if I don’t discharge every —— ——
of them as soon as I get to Haymore!” he added as he led
the way into the building and sat down, not to please Lamia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>but to rest himself, for bodily weakness was one other of
the bad effects of his intemperance.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were but two other passengers besides Gentleman
Geff’s party who got out at Chuxton.</p>

<p class='c009'>These were a middle-aged couple, who walked arm in arm
to the Tawny Lion Tavern, engaged the only carriage there,
and drove on to Haymore Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>These were, of course, Mr. and Mrs. John Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff and his friends waited and waited, the
maid or the valet going out at intervals to see if the carriage
from Haymore Hall had come, or was coming, Gentleman
Geff cursing and swearing freely in the interim.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last he burst out with a fearful oath, adding:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t wait here all night, Leegh—and be —— to
you! Be off with yourself to the Black Lion, or the Brown
Bear, whatever the beastly tavern is called, and see if you
can get a fly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rev. Cassius, glad enough to get out of sight and
hearing of his worthy brother-in-law and patron, hurried
off to the Tawny Lion, and made such haste that he soon returned
with the fly, which had already taken Mr. and Mrs.
John Legg to Haymore Hall and had just come back to
the inn.</p>

<p class='c009'>With many threats, sealed by terrific oaths, of extirpation
of all the domestic establishment at the Hall, Gentleman
Geff entered the carriage with his party and drove off to
meet Nemesis at Haymore Hall.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII<br> <span class='large'>AN ARRIVAL AT HAYMORE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When the curate burst into his wife’s sitting-room with
the joyful news that he was to be the Vicar of Haymore,
his impetuous delight was not inspired by family affection
alone, although he was deeply sensible of the benefits his beloved
ones would derive from the commodious house and
grounds and the liberal income attached to the living; but
he was relieved and satisfied to know that his new flock, in
whom he had already become interested, would not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>turned over to the wolf in sheep’s clothing he knew Cassius
Leegh to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Campbell received his news with a stare of stupefaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” she inquired at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean that Mr. Randolph Hay—the real Mr. Randolph
Hay—the real Squire of Haymore—has offered me the living
of Haymore, which is in his gift, and has invited me to
dine with him this evening to talk over the affair, and
begged me to waive ceremony and bring my wife and daughter
with me to meet his wife and friends. And this he asks
as a particular favor, for particular reasons which shall be
explained when we meet, he adds. Of course I shall go, and
you will both accompany me,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course we will,” readily responded Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa!” exclaimed Jennie in dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you afraid of, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing. But, oh, papa, if I might only remain at
home!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie, dear, would you disoblige a man who is about
to confer a great benefit upon you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not for the world, papa. I will go if you think my failure
to do so would displease Mr. Hay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think it would ‘displease’ him in the sense of
angering him, my dear; for, by Longman’s account, he is
one of the most amiable and considerate of men; but I do
think, from the tone of his note, that it would disappoint
him, for evidently he has a very strong motive for wanting
our presence at Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then certainly I will go. But have you any idea, papa,
what that motive can be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I have, my dear. You know that he who is now
in possession is the rightful squire. But surely you have
not forgotten that the fraudulent claimant has been daily
expected for a week past.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Hetty and Jennie in a breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he is certainly on his way to the Hall this afternoon,
and without a suspicion that the rightful owner of
Haymore is in possession.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jim!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>These exclamations broke simultaneously from the lips
of mother and daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my dear ones; the felon, when he shall enter the
Hall to take possession, as he will think, of his stolen estate,
will be confronted by the friend he treacherously assassinated
and plundered and left for dead to be devoured by the
wolves of the Black Woods in California, eight months ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jim!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a terrible story, my dear ones, as Longman has told
it. But retribution is at hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you think, Jim, that Mr. Hay also wants the
bigamist to be confronted by his forsaken wife?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear, I think he does.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa! papa!” cried Jennie, turning pale.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, you met the man on the steamer when you
were alone and you were not afraid of him. If you meet
him at Haymore you will be on my arm,” said the curate in
a reassuring tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And on your arm I shall fear nothing, papa, dear! And
now I will not distress you any more by my nervous fancies.
I will go, papa, and behave as well as I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is my good, brave girl!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And—I know—Mrs. Longman will take good care of
baby while we are gone,” said Jennie in a tone of confidence,
but with a look of doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course she will! There can be no mistake there!
She will take better care of little Essie than you or I could
with our best endeavors. ‘Why?’—do you ask?—because
she is an experienced nurse and a conscientious woman—and
a tender mother! Are those reasons enough?” demanded
Hetty, laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>The proposed visit to Haymore Hall had for its suspected
object a very grave and important matter. Yet these two
women began immediately to think of the trifling items—what
they should wear!</p>

<p class='c009'>It is always so! Whether a woman is to be married or
executed, her toilet seems to be an affair of the most serious
consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary Stuart’s dress was as artistically arranged for the
block as ever it had been for her bridals.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Jennie’s big trunk was unlocked and invaded. She had
several dresses, gifts from her generous friends in New
York, much handsomer than Hetty had ever possessed; and
mother and daughter were near enough of a size to make
any dress in the collection fit either.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty, having her choice, selected a mazarine blue satin,
trimmed with deep flounces of Spanish lace, which very
well suited her fair, rosy face and sunny brown hair. Jennie
chose a ruby silk, trimmed with fringe of the same color,
which well set off her rich brunette complexion, dark eyes
and dark hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>On ordinary occasions of neighborly visiting for so short
a distance as that between the parsonage and the Hall the
curate and his wife and daughter would have walked, but
with such—to them—grand toilets, the two women required
a carriage, which now, with his improved prospects, Mr.
Campbell could well afford.</p>

<p class='c009'>So a passing boy was called from the road and dispatched
to the Red Fox to engage Nahum with his mare “Miss
Nancy,” and the nondescript vehicle called by the proprietor
a “fly,” by the curate a “carryall,” and by the village boys
a “shandy-ray-dan.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At precisely six o’clock this imposing conveyance was at
the gate of the parsonage waiting for the parson and his
party.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, at Haymore Hall, preparations were completed
for the reception of the most incompatible company
that ever could be gathered together.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us take a look at the people in the house and at the
guests they were expecting</p>

<p class='c009'>First, as to the inmates, there were Ran and Judy—Mr.
and Mrs. Randolph Hay—their solicitor, Mr. Will Walling;
their brother, young Michael Man; the hunter, Samson
Longman, and the old miner, Andrew Quin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three last-mentioned men—Man, Longman and Quin—could
all swear to the identity of the squire in possession
as the real Mr. Randolph Hay, and to the fraudulent claimant
as an adventurer known to them by the name of Geoffrey
Delamere and the nickname of Gentleman Geff.</p>

<p class='c009'>To this party was coming Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and
their daughter, Mrs. Montgomery, who could all testify to
the identity of the same fraudulent claimant and bigamous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>bridegroom, as an ex-captain of foot in her majesty’s service,
whom they had known and who had married Jennie
Campbell under his real name of Kightly Montgomery.</p>

<p class='c009'>And also Mr. and Mrs. John Legg, who could certainly
point out the deceived “bride,” the so-called Mrs. Randolph
Hay, once called Miss Lamia Leegh, as their daughter,
Lydia Legg, and the clerical impostor, the Rev. Cassius
Leegh, as their son Clay Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>All these hosts and guests would make up the receiving
party who, at eight o’clock that evening, would be waiting
to welcome Gentleman Geff, his lady and her brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>At six o’clock the resident party in the Hall were gathered
in the drawing-room in full evening dress, waiting for
their guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy wore her wedding dress of cream-colored silk,
trimmed with duchess lace, but without the veil or orange
flowers, and with pearl jewelry instead. It was the prettiest,
if not the only proper dress for the occasion that she possessed,
her wardrobe being but a schoolgirl’s outfit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran also wore his wedding suit, because—but will this
be believed of the young squire of Haymore?—it was the
only dress suit with which the careless young fellow had as
yet thought to provide himself!</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike, Dandy and Longman wore, also, each his “marriage
garment,” which had been provided for Ran’s and
Judy’s wedding, and for the like reason—that they had no
others for full dress occasions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Walling, being the dude of dudes in society, had a
choice among a score of evening suits, so much alike that
none but a connoisseur could have seen any difference between
them. He wore one of these.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sort of ser’ous time, Mr. Walling,” said old Dandy, who
found himself seated next to Mr. Will near the great open
fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t see why it should be for you, Mr. Quin,” said Will
Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No? Don’t ee, now? Well, I allus did hate a furse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fuss? Why, there will not be any.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran, Judy, Mike and Longman, who were standing in
the front bay window looking out upon the drive and chatting
together, now came sauntering up to the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“What is the matter with Dandy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is afraid there will be a ‘furse,’” gravely replied
Will Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the peals of his mirth subsided, heavy, rumbling,
tumbling wheels were heard on the drive, and the “shandy-ray-dan”
drew up before the Hall door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mirthful group composed themselves to receive their
first guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door was opened by a footman, who announced:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Rev. Mr. Campbell, Mrs. Campbell, Mrs. Montgomery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the party from the parsonage entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Judy went to meet them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Rev. Mr. Campbell?” said Ran interrogatively as he
offered his hand to the curate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell bowed assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad to see you, sir. Mrs. Campbell, I presume?
And Mrs. Montgomery, also? Ladies, I am very
happy to make your acquaintance. Permit me to present
you to Mrs. Hay,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>And when this and all the other introductions were over
and they were seated near the great open fire that the chill
of the December evening made so welcome as well as so
necessary, Mrs. Campbell, observing Judy’s painful, blushing
shyness, and attributing it all only to her extreme youth
and inexperience, and not at all to the conscious ignorance
that she did not expect in the young bride, addressed conversation
to her and tried to draw her out.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Judy blushed and fidgeted and answered only in
monosyllables. She was so absurdly afraid of falling into
that dialect which some of her friends thought one of the
quaintest, sweetest charms about her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have lived most of your life in America?” said
Mrs. Campbell, rather as stating a fact than putting a
question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am,” breathed Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have never seen America, but my daughter here spent
several months over there, and I think she was very much
pleased with the country and the people—eh, Jennie?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>inquired Mrs. Campbell with the intention of drawing Mrs.
Montgomery into the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I was, indeed. Everybody was so kind to me,” replied
the young woman so heartily that Judy felt immediately
drawn toward her, and thenceforth the intercourse of
the three became easier.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell, to promote a good, social understanding,
also contrived to introduce the subject of mining in the gold
fields of California. And here all his companions were, so
to speak, at home. Every one, except the curate’s party, had
something to contribute of instruction upon this matter.
Even Judy forgot her fear of falling into dialect, and was
led to speak freely of home life in the mining camps and
woman’s work and mission there.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole company was on a full flow of conversation
when the butler opened the door and announced dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran immediately arose, offered his arm to Mrs. Campbell,
and begged Mr. Campbell to take in Mrs. Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Will Walling, with one of his most lady-killing
glances, offered his arm to Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p class='c009'>And they all went to the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>But neither in the drawing-room nor at the dinner table
was the slightest allusion made to the real motive of their
gathering.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later, when the whole party had returned to the
drawing-room and the talk had wandered from the silver
mines of Colorado to those of Siberia, a footman entered
the room and spoke to his master apart, and in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Two persons to see Mr. Andrew Quin?’ Show them in
here, Basset. Or, stay!—Mr. Quin!” exclaimed Ran, turning
to his old friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy came up in a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here are two people inquiring for you. They may come
upon private business with you. I don’t know, of course.
So, shall they come in here, or should you prefer to meet
them first?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I know who they are! They are my niece and
nevvy from Hantz. I’ll go and meet them!” said Dandy in
a delighted tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then bring them in here and introduce them to
me,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Dandy followed the footman out into the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>There he found a tall, thin, gray-haired man clothed in
an ulster from head to heel, holding in his left hand a warm
cap, and on his right arm a stout, rosy, handsome woman in
a black velvet bonnet and a gray plaid shawl that nearly
covered the whole of her black silk dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You—you—you are—my niece—Julia Quin—as was?”
inquired old Dandy, moving doubtfully toward the smiling
woman and holding out his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed; that is, you are Uncle Andrew,” the visitor
exclaimed, taking the offered hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, to be sure I am!” he cried, drawing her up and
kissing her heartily. “And would you believe it, my wench,
but this is the first time I have kissed a ’oman for more
than twenty years! And now interdooce me to your hubby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is hardly need; he knows who you are! Shake
hands long o’ your nephy,” she answered, laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two men simultaneously advanced and met.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am proud to make your acquaintance, sir,” said John
Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I yours,” answered Dandy, cordially, if a little
incoherently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you didn’t know me, Juley, did you, now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not by sight, Uncle Andrew. You have changed some,”
replied Mrs. Legg, smiling and showing all her fine teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So have you! So have you! And a deal more ’n I
have! I left you a tall, slim, fair wench under twenty, and
I find you a broad, stout, rosy woman over forty. If that
ain’t a change I’d like to know what a change is!” said
Dandy triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, your change! When you left us to seek your fortune
in the gold fields of California you were a stout, broad-shouldered,
red-faced and red-headed man of forty. Now
you are a thin, pale, silver-haired old gentleman over sixty,”
retorted Julia, artfully mingling flattery with truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that is so; that is so,” meekly assented old Dandy;
and then, meditatively, he added: “And I like it to be so.
I like to think a good deal of my body wasting away in the
sweet, sunshiny air while still I am able to walk about in
it; so as when, I leave it there’ll be only skin and bone to
lay in the ground—or very little more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Uncle Dandy, don’t talk that a way! You can’t be
much over sixty, and you may live to be over eighty or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>ninety—that is twenty or thirty years for you to live in
this world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘What for?’ Why—why, to be a comfort to your dear
niece who loves you,” replied Mrs. Legg, not consciously
hypocritical, but self-deceived into the notion that she was
sincere.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” grunted Dandy in a tone which left his niece in
doubt whether he disbelieved her or not.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the old man, feeling himself fatigued by standing
a few minutes, remembered that he had impolitely, even
if unintentionally, kept his relatives in the same position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, excuse me! Take seats! take seats!” he said, waving
his hands wildly around the hall among the oaken and
leather-cushioned chairs with which it was furnished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. and Mrs. Legg seated themselves on two of the
nearest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy drew a third up before then and dropped into it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll come home ’long of us and stop for good, Uncle
Andrew, I hope,” said Mrs. Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the old man could reply Mr. Legg took up the
word.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, we should be proud to have you a member of
our family for the rest of your life! And may it be a long
and happy one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do thank ye, niece and nephy! I do, indeed! But I
don’t know ’bout going home ’long of you now! You see,
I’m stopping here ’long o’ my young friend, Mr. Randolph
Hay, and wisiting of him, am sort o’ at his orders——”
began Dandy, but his niece interrupted him hastily, almost
indignantly, with:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t mean to say, Uncle Andrew Quin, that while
ever you have got a ’fectionate niece and nephy ready to
share their last crust ’long o’ you as you have gone at your
age and tuk service at the Hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord! No, wench! What are ye talking on? Didn’t I
tell ’ee that Mr. Randolph Hay was a friend of mine? And
didn’t I tell ’ee I was a-visiting on him? What be ye
a-thinking on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, what did you mean by being at his orders?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! just to give my testimony onto a certain matter in
case of need. And I say I can’t give you any answer to your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>invitation until I see how things be gwine to turn out at
the Hall!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! how long will that be?” demanded Mrs. Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe a few hours, if it don’t go into court; maybe a
few centuries if it do. And in the last case, I sha’n’t be here
so long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle Dandy, you speak in riddles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must do that at the present moment, my dear. But in
a few hours, or a few centuries, if you haven’t guessed them
in that time, I will give you the answers to them riddles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle Andrew, we thought by your sending a telegram
to us to ‘come at once,’ that you were very ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my wench, I thank you and him for coming so
very prompt. I do, indeed! So much prompter than I
could expect! Really, I didn’t think you would get here
until some time to-morrow. But I’m glad and thankful as
you’re here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you are not ill, Uncle Dandy. You are very well,
thank the Lord!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never said I was ill, Juley. I said I wasn’t able to
travel. No more I ain’t. And no more I wasn’t. I’m a
feeble old man, wench.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut! tut! ‘Feeble old man,’ indeed! You are a ‘fine
old English gentleman,’ as the song says. And now you
have come home to old England so well off and so well-looking
you will be getting married and putting some
blooming young aunt-in-law over our heads!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Blooming young’ fiddlesticks!” giggled old Dandy, not
displeased at the words of his niece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what made you telegraph us in such hot haste?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Cause, after being away so long and coming so far, I
got into a sort of fever to see my kin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we were in a fever to see you, you dear uncle, from
the moment we got your dispatch. And we thank you now
for sending it, although it did frighten us nearly to death
on your account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it strange you should have cared so much for an
old uncle you hadn’t seen nor heerd tell on for twenty years
or more?” demanded Dandy with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Strange or not, it was so. But is it stranger than that
you should have cared so much for me as to send a telegram
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and be in a fever to see me? Come, Uncle Dandy! You
know ‘blood is thicker than water.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is so! Yes, that is so!” muttered the old man
meditatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Julia! I think that we must go. You see, Mr.
Quin——Or may I call you Uncle Quin?” inquired John
Legg, interrupting his own speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle Quin, Uncle Andrew, Uncle Dandy—whichever
you please,” cordially replied the old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, Uncle Quin, I must tell you that we are very glad
to find you in such good health. We are sorry, though, that
you cannot go home with us at once. We shall have to return
to Medge to-morrow. To-night, however, we shall
have to find quarters in the village here, and will see you
again in the morning before we leave. Shall we say good-night
now?” said John Legg, offering his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, stay! stop! I forgot! Mr. Randolph Hay wishes
to see you both—wants to make your acquaintance—and
made me promise to bring you into the drawing-room.
Come!” said Dandy, taking the offered hand of his nephew
and trying to draw him toward a door.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg hesitated, looked at his wife, and then inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s in there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Squire and wife, and brother-in-law and lawyer, parson
and wife and daughter, and a backwoodsman—all plain people
as you needn’t be afraid on; I ain’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We would rather not go in. We are not exactly dressed
for company, right off a railway journey, and a very long
one at that, as we are. Can’t you step in and persuade the
young squire to come out and speak to us? You can tell
him how it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll go and try,” said Dandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he returned to the drawing-room, went up to Ran,
and whispered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Hay, my niece and nephy be plain folk and a bit
shy. They want to pay their respects to you, but don’t like
to face the company in the drawing-room. Will you please
come and speak to them in the hall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” replied Ran, rising; and then turning to his
friends he added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am called out for a moment. Will you excuse me?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Smiles and nods from every one answered him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He followed Dandy to the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Randolph Hay, sir,” said the old man with solemn
formality, “will you have the goodness to allow me to interdooce
to your honor my niece and nephy, Juley and John
Legg?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia stood up and dropped her rustic, housemaid’s courtesy.
John took off his hat and bowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran held out a hand to each, saying cordially:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad to see you. Your uncle is one of my
oldest and most esteemed friends; so that any friends of his
own shall always be most heartily welcome. You are just
from Hantz?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Straight, sir. Arrived by the train that reached Chuxton
at six o’clock this evening,” answered John Legg.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII<br> <span class='large'>ANOTHER ARRIVAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now that was the train by which Ran had expected
Gentleman Geff and his suit, and this was about an hour
beyond the time when they were due at Haymore. So his
next question was the inevitable one:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did any other passengers leave that train for Haymore?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then John Legg stopped to laugh a little before he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! yes, sir. There were two gentlemen and a lady. I
didn’t see their faces nor hear their names, but they seemed
to belong to some seat in the neighborhood, for the tallest
of the gentlemen seemed to have expected the family carriage
to be there on the spot to meet the party. And when
he found that it was not, well, sir, I don’t think as in all my
long life I ever heard such a vast amount and choice variety
of cursing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gentleman Geff all over!” muttered Dandy to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What became of them?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know, sir. We left him there cursing land and
water, sun, moon and stars, so to speak, and threatening the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>destruction of the earth, or words to that effect, if his carriage
and servants failed to appear within the next five
minutes. We walked to the Tawny Lion Inn and secured
the only conveyance to be found and came on here while the
gentleman waited for his coach and four, or whatever it
might have been.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is waiting there still, probably, and will have to
wait until your ‘conveyance’ returns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir, that will not be long. Julia and myself are
about to say good-night,” said John Legg respectfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Good-night,’ indeed! By no means! What do you
mean? Come two hundred miles or so to see your uncle
here at Haymore Hall, and after an hour’s visit say good-night?
Not at all! You and Mrs. Legg will, I hope, give
us the pleasure of remaining with us during your stay in
Yorkshire,” said Ran heartily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind, sir, and we thank you very much,
but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg paused and looked at his wife, who did not
help him by a word or a glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I will take no denial. Where shall I send for your
luggage?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have nothing but hand-bags, sir, and they are in the
carryall outside. You see, we came directly from the Chuxton
station to this house, and have all we carried in the
vehicle with us. We intended to return in it, and to put up
at the Red Fox Inn in your village here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will do no such thing. You will get your hand-bags
out of the carriage, send it back to Chuxton—where
the swearing gentleman is waiting, swearing harder than
ever, no doubt—and you will remain here with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say, Juley?” said John Legg, appealing to
his wife. “Come, woman, can’t you help a fellow a little?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say, Uncle Dandy?” inquired Julia, appealing
in turn to her old relative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You stop here! Both on you stop! You take Mr. Hay
at his word! Ran Hay means every word that he speaks.
If he says he wants you to stop here he does want you to
stop here! And as he does, you ought to do it to please him
as well as yourselves, which you will be sure to do, I know.
That’s all I have got to say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Dandy was speaking and his niece and nephew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>listening, Ran beckoned a footman to follow him, and
stepped out of the front door and went up to the driver of
the carryall, who stood by the horses’ heads, clapping his
thickly gloved hands and stamping his heavily shod feet to
keep warm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You came from Chuxton?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, and been waiting here for more’n an hour for
the parties I fotch, and myself near frozen, spite of my piles
of clothes and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Charles,” said Hay, turning his head and speaking in a
low voice to the footman, “go in and get a large mug of
strong ale and bring it out to this man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The footman vanished on his errand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The driver continued as if he had not been interrupted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horses like to catch their death of cold, spite o’ two
heavy blankets apiece laid o’ top of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry I can do nothing for your horses, but if you
think any of the grooms might, just let them do it,” said
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir. There can’t nobody do nothing for ’em here.
And nothing will help them but a brisk trot back to Chuxton
and a warm mash and good bed when they get there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The footman came out with a pewter quart measure of
strong, foaming ale and handed it to the driver.</p>

<p class='c009'>The latter took it with a “thanky” to the server and a
bow to the master, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir. This saves my life. Here’s to a long
and happy one for you and yours. Is the party inside ready
to go back, if you please, sir?” inquired the driver after he
had taken one long draught of the ale and stopped to draw
a deep sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are not going back. Charles, get the bags and
other effects out of the carriage and carry them into the
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The footman obeyed, loading himself with two heavy
bags, two rugs and a large umbrella, and took them into
the hall while the driver was taking his second long pull at
the ale.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much is your fare?” inquired Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man stopped to recover breath with another devout
inhalation of enjoyment, and then answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten shillings, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Ran took out his purse and gave the man half a sovereign
and half a crown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir,” said the driver, touching his hat, not
for the fare, but for the “tip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he took the blankets off his horses, folded and put
them under his box and mounted to his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You had better drive as fast as you can, not only for
the sake of warming the blood of the horses, but for that
of cooling the temper of the gentleman who is waiting for
you with his party at the station.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Another fare to-night, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, so I hear from the people you have just brought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the master won’t only have to find fresh horses,
but a fresh driver, sir; for I’m just dead beat. Any more
commands, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not any.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, then, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The driver took up his “ribbons” and started his horses
in a brisk trot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran turned to re-enter the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was met by John Legg running out bareheaded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” demanded Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man has gone off without his fare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, go in the house—you will catch your death of
cold; but you can’t stop him now. He is through the lodge
gates by this time,” said Ran, playfully taking John Legg
by the shoulders and turning him “right face forward” to
the ascending steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>They re-entered the house together.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Legg had already taken off her heavy shawl and
bonnet, and had arranged her hair before the hall mirror,
and stood in her neat plain dress, with fresh <i><span lang="fr">crêpe lis</span></i> ruches—which
she had taken from the flap pocket outside her bag—around
neck and wrists, and her only ornaments a gold
watch and chain and a set of pearls, consisting of brooch
and earrings, which had been her husband’s wedding present
to herself and which she always carried about her when
traveling for fear, if left at home, they might be stolen.
These she had now taken from her pocket and put on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Altogether she was quite presentable in that drawing-room.
And as, with all, she was a “comely” matron, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>husband looked upon her with pardonable pride as well as
love.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while furtively glancing at his wife he was putting
off his ulster and speaking to his host all at the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hadn’t a notion what you were about,” he was saying,
“until your man came in loaded down with our luggage. As
soon as I saw that and found out what you had done I
hurried out to pay the fare, but the carryall had gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is all right,” said Ran. “Come in now and let me
introduce you to my friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, Mr. Hay, let me brush his hair and put a clean
collar and bosom on him first. I won’t be two minutes,”
pleaded Mrs. Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran yielded, and the man’s toilet was made in the hall,
as the woman’s had been a few minutes previous.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ran took Mrs. Legg on his arm and led the way
into the drawing-room, followed by old Dandy and John
Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hay presented his new visitor first to his wife and then
to all his guests. And the plain pair, it is almost needless
to say, were as cordially received by the cultured people
from the English rectory as they were by the border men
from the Californian mining camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>When this little ripple in the circle had subsided all settled
again into small groups.</p>

<p class='c009'>The four women found themselves temporarily together,
and fell to talking of the weather, servants, children and
the approaching Christmas holidays.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Campbell and her daughter sat one on each side of
Julia and made much of her. No word from Hetty or Jennie
revealed the fact that Mrs. John Legg had once been in
their service.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Julia made no secret of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was housekeeper at the rectory of Medge, ma’am, in
the old lady’s time, three years before his reverence was
married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She means in my grandmother’s days,” put in Mr.
Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And for eighteen years afterward; making twenty-one
years in all that I lived with the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell.
I held that child, Miss Jennie—Mrs. Montgomery
that now is—on my lap when she wasn’t twenty-four hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>old. And nursed her and took care of her from the time
of her birth until that of her marriage,” said Julia.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Jennie, who was holding her hand, raised and
pressed it to her own breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; and I have lived with them ever since, up to the
time when they left to come up here to Yorkshire. Then
I took Mr. Legg’s offer and married him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you have been very happy,” said Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am as happy, dear, as I can be parted from you all.
We came to Haymore to see Uncle Dandy. And we intended
to go to-morrow and see you. We little expected to
find you here. I haven’t seen his reverence since the day he
married John and me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was the last ceremony he ever performed in Medge
parish church,” said Mrs. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>While they talked in this manner of strictly personal and
domestic matters, the rector himself was one of a group
gathered around Mr. Will Walling, who was another Gulliver
or Munchausen for telling fabulous adventures of
which he himself was the hero.</p>

<p class='c009'>The inevitable subject of mining had suggested to Mr.
Will the story of the horrors of penal serviture in the silver
mines of the Ural Mountains, and he was telling it as if the
false charge, the secret conviction, the exile, the journey,
the life in the mines, the escape and flight through the snow
and ice of Siberia, and all the attendant awful sufferings
had been in his own personal experience. And all his audience
listened with the fullest faith and deepest interest—that
is, all except two—Ran, who had heard the story told
before to-night, and John Legg, who had very recently read
it in a dilapidated old volume bought for threepence at a
second-hand book stand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran was bored, and could hardly repress the rudeness of
a yawn; and he saw, besides, that John Legg looked incredulous
and sarcastic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he thought of the party of sinners who were by this
time on their way to Haymore and to judgment. And then
that their coming would bring pain and shame to more than
one of that party. But all—even poor Jennie—had been
prepared for the event except John Legg. Then it occurred
to him that he must warn the poor father of the shock that
might otherwise overwhelm him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>He stopped and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Legg, will you favor me with a few minutes’ conversation
in the library?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely, sir,” replied the greengrocer with alacrity as
he arose to accompany his host.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Friends, will you excuse us for a few moments?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if we must,” replied Will Walling, answering for
the company; “but, really, you know, it is a shame to go
before you have heard the end of the story.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I have heard you tell it many times,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but Mr. Legg hasn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I have done better than that. I have been through
it. Why, man, I was the very Enokoff who helped Wallingski
to make good his flight across the frontier. Only my
real name was not Enokoff, but Legginoff, or Legenough, if
you like it better,” said the greengrocer as he followed Ran
from the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Walling started, but could make nothing of the
answer; yet to his circle of listeners he said in explanation:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too bad of Hay to have anticipated me and told that old
fellow the end of the story while they were pretending to
listen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Ran had led his companion to the library,
where both sat down on a leathern armchair, on opposite
sides of a narrow table, on which they leaned their arms,
facing each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, sir, I am at your service,” said Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you smoke?” inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only occasionally; when I need a sedative and philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly. I smoke semi-occasionally for the same reasons.
Will you take an exceptionally fine cigar now? It is
an Isabella Regina.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran produced a case and matches. They lighted their
weeds and began to smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran let a few minutes elapse to allow the sedative to take
some effect upon his guest, and then broke the subject for
which he had brought the old man there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Legg, I hope you will pardon me for asking a question
that may seem to be an unpardonable liberty,” he said
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“Ask me what you please, sir. I am sure it will not be an
offensive liberty, since you could not possibly take one,”
gravely replied the old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, when did you hear from your son and your
daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no son or daughter, sir. The young man and
woman to whom you may allude forsook our humble way of
life as soon as we had finished educating them above their
position, each taking his or her way. Yet I am often sorry
for them and anxious about them, for they were once my
children, though they discard and despise me, for I know
that for that very reason they must come to grief and shame
in this world as well as in the next, if they do not repent
and reform. For, look you, Mr. Hay, I am an old man, and
all my long life I have noticed this one thing—that a man
may break every commandment in the decalogue, except
one, and he may escape punishment in this world, whatever
becomes of him in the next. I say he may, and he often
does. But if he breaks the Fifth Commandment—called
the Commandment with Promise—his punishment, or his
discipline of pain and failure, comes in this world. However,
upon repentance, he may be forgiven in the next.
This is the fruit of my observation and experience of men.
I cannot answer for those of other people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr. Legg, I fear your opinion is about to be sustained
in the fate of the young people. They are both about
to come to grief; and I am glad for the girl’s sake that you
are here to-night, for I am sure you would stand by your
daughter in her trouble,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man stared at the earnest young speaker and
then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“So it was for this, Mr. Hay, that you made old Andrew
Quin bring me here by telegraph.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! Heaven knows I had nothing whatever to do with
bringing you to Haymore. That was entirely Mr. Quin’s
own idea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it was old Andrew that worked to bring about my
visit here in the interest of my undutiful daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! Again you are wrong. Andrew Quin knew nothing
whatever of your chance of meeting your son or daughter
at Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the present crisis is accidental.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Providential, rather.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I stand corrected. Where are these people now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are on their way to this house. They will be here
in one hour from this time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My wretched son and daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Mr. Legg. Your son and daughter, and the man
that she believes to be her husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man that she believes to be her husband! Believes
only! Heaven and earth! has she fallen as low as that?”
groaned the father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not knowingly. Not guiltily. Neither state, church
nor society will hold her guilty of a deep wrong that she
has suffered, not committed. Hers was not an elopement.
Not a clandestine marriage. Her courtship was open. Her
engagements approved by all her friends. Her wedding
was public, and the reception that followed was the social
event of the season.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet the man is not her husband?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because he was and had been a married man for two
years previous to his meeting with your daughter. Because
he was and is a bigamist. More than that, he is a forger,
a perjurer, a swindler, a highway robber and a midnight
assassin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Heaven! Great Heaven!” groaned the wretched
father, covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a word, this man may be called the champion criminal
of his age,” continued Ran, unmercifully “piling up
the agonies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how is it that he is at large?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because his crimes have only recently been brought to
light.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this man has betrayed my poor girl!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was not her fault.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—ah, me!—it was. Her pride, beauty and ambition
have brought her to ruin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! You may still help and save her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I doubt it. But tell me all about it,” said poor John
Legg, sinking back in his chair and covering his working
features with his open palms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran began and told the whole story of the connection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Gentleman Geff, Lamia Leegh, Jennie Campbell and himself,
comprised within the last year.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And in the room there,” he concluded, “gathered to
meet and confound the great criminal are the witnesses of
his crimes, the testifiers to his identity, and, more terrible
than all, his victims, raised as it were from the dead against
him. Among them Jennie Montgomery, the daughter of
James Campbell, the girl who was nursed and brought up
for sixteen years by your good wife, and who was married,
then deserted, and finally stabbed by that felon. Among
them, too, myself, Ran Hay, the friend who shared his
cabin and his crust—nay, his heart and soul—with him,
and yet whom he shot down from behind at midnight in the
Black Woods of California. Among them, too, will be the
wronged father of that unhappy girl——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no! No! no! Oh, Mr. Hay! I cannot be present
at that scene! The sight of me would add to her suffering.
No! When it is all over, and the man who has spoiled her
life has been exposed, then take care of her for a few hours
and afterward let her know of her father; that, however his
heart may have been hardened against his vain, haughty,
disdainful daughter, it is softened by his humbled, grieved
and suffering child. Let her know that her father’s arms
and her father’s home are ever opened to his daughter. But
I cannot see her to-night, Mr. Hay. I am very grateful to
you, sir. I understand you now. But please leave me and
send Julia to me. She knows how to deal with me better
than any one else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will do so at once. And, Mr. Legg, please use this
house and the servants just as if they were entirely your
own. Call for anything you may like, and do exactly as you
choose,” said Ran as he took the old man’s hand, pressed it
kindly, and left the library.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then John Legg dropped his head upon his folded arms
on the table and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other arms were soon around him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia stood there.</p>

<p class='c009'>He told her all in fewer words than Ran had taken to
tell the story.</p>

<p class='c009'>She drew a chair and sat down beside him, took his hand
and held it while she said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Well, don’t cry no more. The girl has had her lesson;
but the shame of her marriage is not hern or ourn. We will
take her home and give her love and comfort and peace, if
we cannot give her happiness. I will be as true and tender
a mother to her as if she were my own hurt child. And
her own mother looking down from heaven will see no cause
to blame me. At Medge her story need never be known.
She will be the Liddy Legg of her youth. She went for to
be a governess in a rich American family—she has come
home now for good. That is true, and it’s all of the truth
that need be known at Medge. The writing between the
lines need not be read there. And there is Uncle Dandy,
who is just as kind as he is rich. He will surely be good to
the poor gal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly Julia paused and fell into deep thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>While she had been comforting her husband in his sorrow
over his miserable daughter her own better nature was
aroused, and when finally she had occasion to allude to her
old uncle she felt ashamed of the selfish and avaricious
spirit that had inspired her to run after him for his imaginary
wealth and to covet its inheritance, and she secretly
resolved to try, with the Lord’s help, to put away the evil
influence and think of the old relative as a lonely old man
whose age and infirmities it should be not only her duty but
her pleasure to cherish and support.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then the spirit of avarice departed for the time
being, at least; for a devil cannot endure the presence of an
angel.</p>

<p class='c009'>While this change was silently passing within her she
still held her husband’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length she spoke again, slightly varying the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about the boy?” she inquired, referring to his son.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man, you mean; for he is twenty-eight years old.
I don’t know! I hope he will never get a pulpit, for I know
this much, that he is totally unfit for one; yes, and the
bishops, whose boots he is always licking in the hope of
preferment, know it, too! He got the promise of the living
here at Haymore from the fraudulent claimant who has
ruined us all, or tried to do so; but that goes for nothing
at all, for Mr. Randolph Hay has already given it to the
Rev. Mr. Campbell, a good man and worthy minister. So
my vagabond will also have to meet with humiliating disappointment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>along with his felonious patron and wretched
sister.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think no more on it, except to do the best you can and
leave the rest to the Lord,” said Julia.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment the door opened and a footman entered
with a large tray laden with tea, bread and butter, game
pie, cakes, sweetmeats and other edibles. He put it down
on the tables between the two people and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mistress thought, sir, that you might like refreshments
after your journey. And would you prefer a bottle
of wine, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you; nothing more whatever. You need not
wait,” replied Mr. Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man touched his forehead and left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy had remembered what Ran, with all his goodness of
heart, had forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, then, it is almost always Eve, and seldom or never
Adam, who is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“On hospitable thoughts intent,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>in the way of feeding at least.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia poured out tea for her husband and filled his plate
with game pie and bread and butter, and made him eat and
drink and set him a good example in that agreeable duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime the company in the drawing-room were
getting a little weary of waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hay had contrived to draw the curate aside, where
they could settle the affair of the living. It was but a short
conference, for Mr. Campbell was glad and grateful to accept
it. At the end of their talk the minister said very
sincerely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The utmost that I dared to hope for was the curacy
under the new rector, whoever he should be! But the living!
It is more than I ever dreamed of or deserved! Yet
will I, with the Lord’s help, do my utmost for the parish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What Ran might have replied was cut short with some
sudden violence.</p>

<p class='c009'>First by the heavy rumbling and tumbling of some clumsy
carryall over the rough drive as it drew up to the front of
the Hall and stopped; then by loud and angry tones of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>voice; then by a resounding peal of knocks on the door
which seemed to reverberate through the entire building.</p>

<p class='c009'>The arrival was an embodied storm that threatened to
dash in the entire front of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the library John Legg sprang up and bolted the door
against the uproar, and then sat down by his trembling
wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the drawing-room all was excitement and expectation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s him!” exclaimed old Dandy, with his few spikes of
white hair rising on end around his bald crown. “It’s him!
Straight from the pit of fire and brimstone, and possessed
of the devil and all his demons!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the hall the frightened footmen hastened to throw
open the front door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff burst in, cursing and swearing in the
most appalling manner, and threatening every one in his
house with instant discharge, death and destruction, for having
kept him waiting at Chuxton so many hours and not
having sent his coach and four and mounted servants to
meet him!</p>

<p class='c009'>So, raving like a madman whose frenzy is heightened by
<i><span lang="la">mania a potu</span></i>, he broke into the drawing-room in the midst
of the assembled company.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran Hay arose and advanced down the room to meet him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='large'>AT BAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Randolph Hay advanced to meet the violent intruder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff was still raging and threatening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, Mr. Geoffrey Delamere?” coolly inquired
Ran, calling the man of many aliases by the name by
which he had known him in California.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff stopped suddenly and drew himself up
with drunken arrogance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the quiet, low-voiced, well-dressed young gentleman
who stood before him, with clear, pale complexion, neatly
trimmed hair and mustache, who wore light kid gloves, and
had a rosebud in his buttonhole, he did not recognize the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>rough, rollicking, sunburned and shock-headed lad who had
befriended him at Grizzly Gulch, and whom he himself had
shot down, robbed and left for dead, to be devoured by
wolves in the Black Woods of the gold State, and whose
name and inheritance he had stolen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who in thunder and lightning are you, you villain?
And what the fire and brimstone are you doing here, in
my house, you rascal?” he fiercely demanded, and without
waiting for an answer he fell to cursing and swearing in the
most furious manner, ending with: “If you don’t get out
of this in double-quick I’ll have you kicked out of doors and
into the horse pond, you scoundrel!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps if you give yourself the trouble to look up in
my face you may recognize me, as well as my right to be
here,” said Ran calmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff stared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should remember me. It has not been so long;
only since the second of last April that we parted company
in the Black Woods of California,” continued Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the criminal’s face blanched, his jaw fell, his eyes
started, he stared with growing horror for a moment, then
reeled, and must have fallen but that he was caught in the
strong arms of Longman, who supported him to a high-backed
armchair and sat him down in it, where he seemed
to fall into a state of stupefaction. The awful shock of this
meeting had not sobered him—he was too far gone in drunkenness
for that; but it had reduced him to a state of imbecility.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Mr. Cassius Leegh, who had been engaged
outside doing all the duties of his patron, seeing to the
luggage, paying off the carryall, and even taking care of his
sister, now strutted into the room with the lady on his arm,
his head thrown back, his nose in the air, and altogether
with a fine manner of scorn.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not so drunk as his patron; he was only drunk
enough to be a very great man, indeed; but not to be a very
violent one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the meaning of this irregularity?” he loftily
demanded. “We did not expect company!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We did,” said Ran with a touch of humor in his tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, who are you, sir?” demanded Leegh, throwing up
his head.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“Ask your companion there,” replied Ran with a wave of
his hand toward the panic-stricken object in the armchair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hay!” exclaimed Leegh, turning to his patron. “What
in the dev—what on earth does all this mean? Who are all
these people?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff opened his mouth, gasped, rolled his eyes
and sank into silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you speak, man? What the dev—what is the matter
with you? And what is all this infer—this confusion
about?” angrily demanded Leegh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff gasped two or three times, rolled his eyes
frightfully and replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the day of judgment! And the dead—the murdered
dead—have risen to bear witness against me!—have
left their graves to cry ‘blood for blood’!” he shrieked; and
then his eyes stared and became fixed, his jaw fell and his
face blanched.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor idiot!” exclaimed Mr. Leegh in extreme disgust.
“I never saw his so drunk as this. If he goes it at this
pace he will soon come to the end of life. I find I must take
command here and clear the house. Have I your authority
to act for you, sister?” he inquired in a whisper of the
woman on his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—yes,” she faltered faintly; “but take me first to a
chair or sofa. I feel as if about to faint. Oh, what does is
all mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It means that our friend here,” he replied, pointing to
the collapsed criminal in the chair, “has delirium tremens.
And ‘has ’em bad,’ as the old costermonger used to say of
his cousin,” he added as he placed his sister in a large,
cushioned armchair, into which she sank exhausted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he glanced over the scene, taking stock of the company
preparatory to his work of clearing the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nearest to him, on his right hand, stood the young colossus,
Samson Longman, leaning over the chair of poor old
Dandy, who sat with his bald head dropped and his withered
face hidden in the palms of his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>These two men were both strangers to Mr. Leegh, who
did not feel inclined to commence his work of expulsion
with the giant or his immediate protégé.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little further off, on his left, stood a group of three—Ran,
Mike and Will Walling—talking together. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>were also strangers to Mr. Leegh, who did not feel disposed
to begin with them either.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still further off, straight before him, at the other end of
the room, was another group, each individual of which he
recognized. These were the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell,
and their daughter, Jennie, whom he had often visited at
their parsonage in Medge; and to Mr. Campbell he had but
lately written, as the reader may remember, warning him
to leave the rectory, to which he himself—Leegh—had been
appointed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, then, was his opportunity. He would begin with
these.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector—as we must call him now, since his induction
into the Haymore living by Mr. Randolph Hay—was seated
on a corner sofa with his wife and daughter, the latter sitting
between her father and her mother, with her distressed
face hidden in that mother’s bosom. Yet Leegh had instinctively
recognized her as well as her parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went up, nodded to Mr. Campbell and offered his
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector bowed in return, but did not take Leegh’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am surprised to see you here this evening, sir. How
do you do, Mrs. Campbell? I hope Miss Jennie is quite
well,” said Leegh in an offhand way, not choosing to notice
the rector’s coolness, not knowing or suspecting that he was
the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am here at the invitation of Mr. Randolph Hay,” said
Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My daughter is quite well, thank you, Mr. Leegh,” said
Mrs. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both the husband and the wife answering his careless
greeting simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear of Miss Jennie’s good health. She is
only tired, then, perhaps, or sleepy? Did you say you were
here at the invitation of the squire, Mr. Campbell?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir; of Mr. Randolph Hay,” calmly replied the
rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he must have been even drun—I mean, more incomprehensible
than he is now. Pray, did he also invite all
these other people I see here?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“I think not. He did not invite you, or your sister, or
Capt. Montgomery,” replied Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t invite me or my sister! Why, my sister is his
wife, man, and I am his brother-in-law! And he brought
us down with him to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think not,” said the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think not! Why, here we are, anyway.  Here am<a id='t235'></a>
I. There is my sister in that armchair, somewhat prostrated
and disgusted, to be sure. And there is her husband on that
high-back throne, somewhat ‘disguised,’ as one might say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you are mistaken in all that you have said,”
quietly remarked Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think that everybody in the room, except myself, is
drunk or demented, or most likely both!” exclaimed Leegh,
losing his temper and now speaking recklessly, for he was
not yet quite sober.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell made no reply to these words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you be good enough to explain yourself?” rudely
demanded Leegh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no explanation to make about myself. For any
other questions you would like to ask I must refer you to
Mr. Randolph Hay himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is in a fine condition to answer questions, is he not,
now? Look at him!” said Leegh, pointing to the abject
creature in the chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector looked and sighed to see the human wreck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, will you explain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I must still refer you to Mr. Randolph Hay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound your insolence!” between his grinding teeth.
And then, aloud: “You got my letter, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Warning me to vacate the rectory?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course. What else should I have written to you
about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I got your letter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I hope you are ready to go. Because I shall certainly
enter into possession on the first of January,” said
Leegh rudely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The rectory is even now quite ready for the new incumbent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear it, though I shall not care to take possession
until the first of January. And now, Mr. Campbell,
excuse me for reminding you that the hour is late, and suggesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>that, as this is the evening of Mr. and Mrs. Randolph
Hay’s arrival, it would be in good form for visitors
to retire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you: but I must speak to my host and hostess
first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment Judy came up from some obscure part of
the big room in which she had been lurking like a frightened
kitten.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell made room for her, and Judy sat down
beside her friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is this young lady? Will you introduce me to
her?” said Leegh with one of his lady-killing smiles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, sir. I would rather not do so,” said Mr.
Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then turning to Judy, who had looked up with surprise
and pity, for she could not bear to see any one pained
or mortified, he added in explanation:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear; I cannot do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, with a smothered imprecation, Leegh turned on his
heel and sauntered down the room to rejoin his sister, and
feeling as if he were in a very weird and ugly dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meanwhile, however, Ran, Mike and Will Walling
had been taking counsel together, and often glancing
from the stupefied figure of Gentleman Geff, who still sat
with blanched face, dropped jaw and starting eyes, staring
into vacancy, to that of Lamia Leegh, who reclined on her
chair with closed eyes and in a half-fainting condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length Ran from the pity of his heart said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Walling, I cannot bear to expose that poor woman to
the awful humiliation of hearing the whole of that fellow’s
villainies exposed. I will go into the library and persuade
her poor father to receive her in there and save her from
this trial. And do you go to her and break the news of Mr.
Legg’s presence in the house. You need tell her no more
as yet. The worst need not be told until later.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I will do as you say. There is her precious
brother talking to Mr. Campbell. I wonder what he is saying,”
said Will Walling as he went up and stood beside the
chair of Lamia Leegh.</p>

<p class='c009'>She never moved or opened her eyes. She did not seem
to have perceived his presence. He wished to address her,
but hardly knew what name to call her. If he should call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>her by her real name, or even by the name she bore in New
York before her marriage, it would startle and offend her.
It would seem a deliberate insult. If he should call her by
Ran’s name it would be by a false one.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last alternative, however, was the one on which he
decided to act. It could do no harm, he thought, to humor
her delusion by calling her by the name she honestly supposed
to be hers by right of marriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>He laid his hand lightly on the back of her chair, stooped,
and said softly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Hay!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She started, opened her eyes, sat up and gazed at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have startled you. I am sorry,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Walling! You here! In England! At Haymore!”
she exclaimed, gazing at him as if she could not turn away
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, as you see!” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we did not know you were coming. At least, I did
not. And, oh! what brought you here? I don’t mean to be
rude, though the question seems a rude one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a most natural one. I came—for a change,” replied
Will Walling evasively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when did you arrive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In England? Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when did you come to Haymore?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Late last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You came straight here, then, expecting to find us at
home, and found no one to receive you—except the servants,
of course. I hope they made you comfortable. And,
of course they told you that we were to be home to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so glad you are here. And, oh, Mr. Walling, since
you are here, will you please to tell me who all these strangers
are and why they are here, and what, oh! what has reduced
my husband to that condition? He looks as if he
were struck with idiocy,” said Lamia with ill-concealed
scorn and hatred.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Walling thought within himself that she would have
little to suffer from wounded affections, whatever she might
have to endure from humbled pride. Still, he pitied her,
and answered gently:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That group on the sofa, to whom your brother is speaking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>consists of the Rev. Mr. Campbell, his wife and daughter,
who are quite old friends of Mr. Leegh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia had never heard the name of Jennie Montgomery’s
parents. She scrutinized the group, and then remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That girl who is leaning on the elder woman’s shoulder
reminds me strongly of some one whom I have seen somewhere,
but I cannot remember where, for I cannot quite see
her clearly at this distance. And who are the other people
in the room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are all friends of Mr. Randolph Hay who knew
him in California, before he came into his estate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how interesting! And they came here to see him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and to give him a reception in his own house,” said
Will Walling, not quite truly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how interesting! And, Mr. Walling, who is that
pretty young woman who has just gone up to the clergyman’s
party?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some friend of the family. Here comes your brother.
He has just left the group. And before he comes, my dear
Mrs. Hay, I must tell you that there are others, or rather,
there is one other person in this house in whom you are
more intimately interested than in all the rest,” said Will
Walling very gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia looked a little disturbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who can that be?” she inquired in a low, faltering
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you not surmise? Think what near relatives you
have living.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—have no near relatives living—except my brother,
and—my father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your father is here, longing to see his only daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My father here? What has he come for?” demanded this
Goneril in so sharp a tone of displeasure and annoyance
that Will Walling lost all pity for her and spoke near his
purpose when he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is waiting here in fatherly love and compassion, to
be a shelter to his only daughter in the hour of her utmost
need.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia turned deadly pale and sick. The words of the
lawyer, taken together with the awful exclamation of her
husband before he fell into his stupor, warned her that
some terrible revelation was at hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“Oh! this is some horrid nightmare!” she muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this crisis the sauntering and unsteady steps of Mr.
Leegh brought him up to his sister’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now!” he exclaimed, “what is all this? And who
the dev—deuce—mischief are you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cassius!” cried Lamia in great excitement. “This
is Mr. Walling, of the firm of Walling &#38; Walling, New
York, of whom you have heard us speak. There is something
dreadful the matter that has gathered all these people
here. He tells me that our father is here also——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The old man! What is the—what has brought him
here?” demanded Leegh in as sharp a tone as his sister
had used.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will Walling was as much disgusted with the one as with
the other. He answered the question:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your father is here, Mr. Leegh, to succor his daughter
in her distress. Presently I shall ask you, her brother, to
lead her to your father’s presence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is my husband. My beast of a husband! What has
he been doing! Oh, Heaven! I heard him say something
about murder, and I thought it was only his drunken raving.
Has he committed murder, then, and will he be
hanged? If so, I will never show my face in England or
New York again!” exclaimed Lamia, losing all decent self-control
and becoming hysterical, not from anxious affection,
but from alarmed pride.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Compose yourself, madam. There is no murder on his
hands. There is nothing but what you may get over in the
peace of your father’s house,” said Will Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why cannot you tell me what it is, then?” demanded
Lamia, breaking into sobs and tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! why the mischief can’t you speak out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I gave my word not to do so. Because, in any
case, I would not do so. Because it is not even proper that
I should. And, finally, because it is best that your sister
should hear what she must from her father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a nightmare! A horrid, hideous nightmare!” cried
Lamia, sobbing violently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When are we to hear this news, whatever it may be—this
mystery, this calamity—from the old gentleman?”
roughly demanded Leegh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the gentleman who is with him now comes out to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>tell us that your father is ready to receive you,” replied
Will Walling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By ——! Upon my honor, you are very cool, sir,”
sneered Leegh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a nightmare! A ghastly, deadly nightmare!”
wailed Lamia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It it the day of doom, and the quick and the dead rise
in judgment!” groaned a deep, hollow voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was that of Gentleman Geff. His rolling eyes had
fallen upon a group composed of Mike, Dandy and Longman,
and he sat staring in horror upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That drunken idiot ought to be carried up to bed,
Lamia,” said Leegh in strong disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will not have him touched,” replied the woman, with
a shudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime Randolph Hay had crossed the hall and
turned the knob of the library door. He found it locked.
Then he rapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is there?” inquired the quavering voice of John
Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is I, your friend, Hay,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door was instantly opened by Julia Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please excuse us and come in, Mr. Hay. We only locked
the door to keep that terrible man from bursting in upon
us,” said Julia apologetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right,” replied Ran, good-humoredly, as he entered
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found John Legg still sitting at the narrow table
from which the little supper had not yet been removed. The
poor man looked pale, haggard, anxious and many years
older than he had seemed a few hours before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran also took the precaution to lock the door before he
came and seated himself at the table opposite John Legg.
Julia drew a chair to the side of her husband, sat down
and took his hands in hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You look troubled, Mr. Hay. You have something more
to tell me about my poor girl, and you shrink from telling
it. But speak out, sir. I can bear it,” said John Legg,
with stoical resignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed, my friend, it is nothing more that I have
to communicate of her; at least, nothing ill. I came in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>here only, to plead for a little change in our plans,” said
Ran soothingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, dear sir? Your kind will should be our
law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By no means!” earnestly exclaimed Ran. “But the
change I wished to make is this: You remember that you
proposed to keep out of your daughter’s way until she
should have heard the worst that she must hear of her real
position?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I shrank, and still shrink, from adding to her
pain and mortification by my presence,” sighed the unhappy
father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear Mr. Legg, consider for one moment. She
has not yet heard the humiliating facts, but it is absolutely
necessary that she should hear them to-night. Now is it
not better that she should hear them from your lips than
from mine or from my lawyer’s? Would she not suffer less
to have the truth told her gently here, in private, by the lips
of her father, than out there, in public, by the lips of a
stranger?”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Ran spoke John Legg sat with his gray head bowed
upon his hands in deep, sorrowful reflection, and when Ran
ceased to speak the poor father made no reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think about this, Mr. Legg?” gently persisted
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know! I don’t know!” moaned the old man in
a heartbroken tone. “What do you say, Julia?” he piteously
inquired, raising his head and appealing to his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>She took his hand again, and looking tenderly in his troubled
face, answered gravely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think, John, indeed, I think, that you had better do
as Mr. Hay advises. It would be dreadful for that poor
girl to hear of her misfortune facing all those people in
there! And you know the man who betrayed her and committed
countless other crimes must be exposed in public
and then expelled from the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia Legg spoke as she thought, but, in fact, Ran had no
intention of turning the wretch in question out of doors in
this freezing winter night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Julia, my dear, I have such confidence in your judgment
that I will do as you say,” replied John Legg in a
low voice. Then turning to Ran, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“Mr. Hay, I am deeply grateful to you for all the aid
and comfort and counsel you give me. You may, sir, if
you please, bring or send my poor child to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will do so at once,” said Ran, and he arose and left
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I will stand by you through all, John. I will be
as good a mother to your unhappy girl as I am a true wife
to you,” said Julia, still holding his hand in hers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV<br> <span class='large'>FATHER AND DAUGHTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And so they waited in suspense for a few moments until
the door opened and Mr. Leegh entered, as usual, with his
head thrown back, his nose in the air, and his sister on his
arm. His head was bowed upon her breast, and her face
was pale and her eyes red and swollen.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg arose and went to meet her with trembling
nerves and outstretched arms. He was but a little over
fifty years of age, yet for the last few hours he looked to be
over seventy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, dear Lyddy! My own poor child!” he said,
drawing her to his breast and holding her there, while he
put out his hand to his son and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, Clay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am well, sir, thank you. How do you do yourself?”
inquired the dutiful son in an offhand, nonchalant manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you see me, Clay. Not very well,” replied the
grieved father, as he sank into a large cushioned chair that
his wife had pushed up to him, and drew his daughter down
upon his lap with her head against his shoulder, where she
lay sobbing her soul forth in pride and anger—not in love
or sorrow. She had not spoken one word as yet since she
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Clay Legg, as we must henceforth call him, because
it is his only right name, threw himself into another armchair
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am told, sir, that you have something to communicate
to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Yes, I have, Clay. Do not cry so. Lyddy, my dear. I
will stand by you. Your father will stand by his daughter,
and love her and comfort her, and shelter and protect her
against all the world,” he said, turning away from his insolent
son and bending over his wildly hysterical daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir,” said Mr. Clay Legg, “since you have something
to communicate, hadn’t you better communicate it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied his father, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But first,” exclaimed Clay Legg, “here is a stranger
present. Are we to discuss private family affairs before a
stranger? And who is that person, anyway?” he demanded,
jerking his thumb in the direction of Mrs. Legg, who had
retired to a short distance and where she sat down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I ought to beg her pardon! For the moment I forgot.
Julia, my love, will you step this way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Legg came promptly at her husband’s request, and
stood before the group.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Julia, this young man here is my son, Clay,
whom you have never seen before. Clay, this is Mrs. Legg,
my wife, your new mother. I hope you will be the best of
friends!” pleaded the husband and father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, I hope so, too!” earnestly responded the new
wife, as she held out her hand with hearty good will to her
stepson.</p>

<p class='c009'>He drew himself up stiffly and bowed, ignoring her
offered hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg noticed his manner and frowned with pain,
not anger, and to cover the awkwardness, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this weeping girl on my bosom is my daughter,
Lydia! She cannot speak to you yet, my dear. She has
not even spoken to me, her father, whom she has not seen
before for the last three years! But she will be better presently,
and then I feel sure that you and she at least will be
good friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed, John! I know we shall!” heartily responded
Julia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now sit down, my dear, and make yourself comfortable.
You already know that I have a painful revelation to make
to my son and daughter here; but as the misfortune to be
spoken of was caused by no conscious complicity of theirs,
it should not cause either of them too much grief, I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“No, indeed! It was not their fault, so they should not
mourn over it,” warmly assented Julia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, sir! Are you going to discuss private family
matters in the presence of this person?” demanded Clay
Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘This person,’ sir, is my beloved wife. I have no secrets
from her. She already knows as much as I do myself, and
as much as I have to tell you,” replied John Legg, speaking
for the first time with some severity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me one thing, if you please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I personally concerned in what you are about to
communicate in the presence of a stranger?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not personally—not at all interested except through
your sister.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that is her concern. If she choose——” And he
turned on his heel and left his sentence unfinished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You had better let me go, John, dear, if the young
people object to my presence during this interview,” said
Julia gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My daughter, do you object to my wife’s presence here
while I make the revelation of which she knows the whole
nature?” whispered John Legg to the agonized girl on his
bosom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! why should I object to anything? I know—before
you tell me—that your dreadful news—concerns some crime
of my wretched husband! If not a murder, that would
hang him, then a forgery or some other felony that will
send him to penal servitude, and will, in any case, be known
all over England to-morrow. Let whom you like hear the
horrid story,” replied the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she first began to speak she gasped and panted,
but as she went on she gained more command over her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia Legg was full of pity for this ungracious creature,
and she came and knelt down beside her husband’s chair,
and took his daughter’s hand in hers and kissed it, murmuring
softly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Believe me, oh! believe me! I will do all in my power
to lighten any trouble you may have, and to make you comfortable
and contented, if not happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia—as we must continue to call her because that is
the name by which the reader has known her from the first—Lamia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>drew her hand away from the kindly hands that
clasped it, and Julia Legg, with a sigh, arose and resumed
her seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My own dear daughter, before I tell you anything more
I must remind you again that in my heart and in my home
you have a haven of peace and love, of rest and safety from
all the storms of life. Do you not know and feel this, my
daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; you are my father, and that is understood,”
she answered coldly, as if a parent’s boundless love, pity
and forgiveness were such mere matters of course that they
needed no recognition. “But I wish you would tell me at
once, and be done with it. What has my miserable husband,
Randolph Hay, done?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg sighed deeply. He did not think “how
sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless
child,” because he had never seen the lines, but he sighed
more than once as he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the first place, my daughter, your miserable husband,
as you call him, is not Randolph Hay, and has not a shadow
of a right to that name or to the estate of Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia started up and looked her father in the face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who and what is he, then?” she fiercely demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An adventurer with many aliases; a fraudulent claimant
of the Haymore estates, who has sustained his false position
by robbery, forgery and perjury, but who has been recently
detected, and who is about to be exposed and punished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not surprised! I am not surprised! I expected
something like this! I did! I did! Tell me, does Mr.
Will Walling know anything about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He knows all about it. His business in England is to
bring that man to justice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia sprang from her father’s arms, throwing him suddenly
back by the violence of her motion, and began to
walk wildly up and down the floor, exclaiming and gesticulating
like a maniac, and thinking only of herself and of
her own interests, and of no one and nothing else under the
sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To bring me to this! Oh, the villain! the villain! But
I will have nothing more to do with him! I will never
speak to him again! I will never look on his face again!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Do you hear me, papa?” she cried, suddenly pausing, with
flashing eyes, before her father’s chair. “Do you hear me,
I say? I will never live with that felon again—never speak
to him—never look at him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My child, you are quite right in your resolution. It
would be wrong and even criminal in you to do otherwise,”
said John Legg, gently drawing his daughter into his arms
again and adding sorrowfully, “for I have something more
to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You could not tell me anything more shameful than
you have already told me! Even if you should prove that
that villain had been a murderer, as well as a robber, forger
and perjurer, it would not be worse, since hanging is no
more disgraceful than penal servitude. To be the wife of
a felon—the wife of a convict! But I will not be! I will
be separated by law! I will be divorced!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This she repeated over so often and with so much excitement
that at last her father said to her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor child, you will not need to appeal to the law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” she demanded, impressed by the
solemnity of his manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will not require a divorce,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is just, in effect, what you said before. Why will
I not require a divorce? The man is not dead, nor going
to die! He will not commit suicide. No, indeed, trust him
for that! He is too great a coward! And he is in no
danger of being hanged. How, then, should you say that
I will not require a divorce, since death is not likely to relieve
me of my felon husband—ugh!” she exclaimed in
strong disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, the man has never been your husband,” he
said slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” she cried, aghast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man has never been your husband!” he repeated
firmly and solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are mad! We are all mad together, I think!
What—under—heaven—do you mean?” she cried, staring at him
with starting eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This man, under his true name of Kightly Montgomery,
married Jennie Campbell, the daughter of the curate of
Medge, in Hantz, more than two years before he ever saw
your face. His wife is living now. She is in the drawing-room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>across the hall. My wife Julia here knows all about
this first marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While John Legg spoke his daughter stared as if her
eyes would have started from out their sockets. Then suddenly
she sprang up and rushed across the room to the side
where her brother sat with one leg crossed over the other,
his head thrown back, and his hands clasped above it, his
face wearing a cynical expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>She paused before him, her eyes flaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cassius!” she said in a voice half choked with raging
hatred and longing revenge. “Cassius, do you hear what
papa has said? Do you hear that your sister has been deceived,
betrayed by the basest of dastards and criminals!
Cassius, kill that man! kill him! kill him! kill him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clay Legg burst into a low, cynical laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let us be tragic, whatever we are, Lyddy. It is a
pity you have been such a fool as to be so easily taken in.
A greater pity that you should have brought discredit on
your family. But you are not the first woman who has ever
been fooled and laughed at. But as for me getting into a
broil with the fellow on your account—no, thank you! It
would be unbecoming to the cloth, and get me into trouble
with the bishop. And as to killing him! Do you really
think I propose to do murder and get myself hanged for
your folly? No, thank you, I say again! You had better
go and hide yourself down in the greengrocer’s shop at
Medge along with papa and stepmamma, while I shall leave
the country where my sister’s conduct has made it impossible
for me to hold up my head and look honorable men in
the face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While this brutal brother spoke his sister stood before
him pallid, staring and biting her lip until the blood flowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shame on you, dastard, to speak to the unhappy girl in
such a manner! Leave the room, sir!” said John Legg,
rising and opening the library door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not want to come in here at first, and I am very
glad to get out,” retorted Clay Legg, with an insulting
laugh, as he walked off.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg shut the door after him and then turned to
his miserable daughter. She had thrown herself down on
a sofa, where she lay with her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>He kneeled beside her and laid his hand on her head,
murmuring softly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must content yourself with our love and our poor
home. These are yours forever. You have tried other love
and found it fail you. Paternal love never fails,” he continued,
and while he spoke he did not cease to smooth and
caress her head with his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to think,” she moaned in a muffled voice, with her
face downward and hidden with her hands; “to think it
was his deserted wife that I shopped for in the last days
before my marriage with him—that it was his deserted wife
with her child—his child—that came over in the same
steamer with him and myself on our bridal trip! Ah! now
I know why he got off the ship at Queenstown! It was to
get out of her sight and to avoid encountering her father
who was to meet her at Liverpool. She was his lawful wife,
and knew it, and she knew then that I was—what was I?—what
am I? Oh! I shall go mad! mad! mad!” she shrieked,
flinging off her fathers hand, springing from the sofa,
clasping her head between her palms and walking wildly
up and down the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, dear child, don’t go on like this! Come and
sit down. Try to compose yourself,” pleaded poor John
Legg, walking after his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, hold your tongue! Let me alone! Don’t I know
what you are thinking in your heart all this time? You are
saying to yourself that this is just what you always expected!
Just what I deserved! You are glad of it in your
heart! Glad to see me punished! Glad to see me mortified!”
she cried fiercely, angry with her father because she
was angry with herself, her betrayer and all the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Lyddy! My darling girl! I know you are not
accountable for what you say now. I blame you for nothing,
child, not even for your words. I could not have the
cruelty to do it. But try to compose yourself and believe
that we love you and will serve you and comfort you!
Lyddy, my daughter, we cannot offer you the wealth and
grandeur and luxuries that you have been lately used to,
but, my dear, a safe home and solid comforts, and peaceful
days and family affection you shall not lack, my girl—you
shall never lack,” pleaded her father; and while he
spoke he followed her up and down with outstretched arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>ready to infold her, up and down, pleading with her, turning
when she turned until at length she whirled around
upon him and hissed at him through her set teeth, her hard
words dropping like leaden bullets from the mold:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will—you—mind—your—own—business? I am of
age! I thought I was Mrs. Randolph Hay, of Haymore!
Lady of the manor here! I entered this house as its lawful
mistress! For what? To find myself deceived, betrayed,
entrapped! Now what am I! Something that must not
even be named to respectable ears like yours!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my dear child! To me you are my wronged and
blameless daughter! Well, rave on! I cannot help it,
though it cuts my heart like a sword! Maybe it relieves you
to talk like this. But presently I hope you will take thought
and come home with me to be comforted,” pleaded John Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia burst into a cruel, sarcastic laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The greengrocer’s house on Market Street, Medge, of
course, would be a perfect paradise to me! I can imagine
the back parlor full of the fragrance of onions, leeks and
other garden stuff from the shop, and enlivened with the
music of the bell every time a customer opened the door!
Not any for me, please! I may go on the stage, or on the
street—why should I care where I go, what I do, or how I
end—after this—so that I enjoy the pride of life in my
prime?” she demanded, looking at the plain, good man before
her with a cruel, sarcastic sneer.</p>

<p class='c009'>He held out his arm to her, with a prayer in every look
and gesture. He even ventured to lay his hand on her in
tender compassion, but she broke away from him and resumed
her wild walk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he sank into an armchair beside him—he could follow
her no further—and dropped his head upon his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife Julia came to his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>She has longed to go to him while he was following and
pleading with his daughter, and getting nothing from her
but insult for love. She had longed to lead him away from
the ungracious and unseemly strife with evil and to say to
him: “Leave the thankless and reckless woman to herself
to recover her senses, if she ever had any, and come with
me and rest.” But—she was a stepmother only to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>willful girl, and she must not interfere between father and
daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now that he sat alone in the collapse of despair after
fruitless effort, bowed down, down with sorrow and wounded
affection, she came to him, put her hand on his shoulder,
laid her cheek lightly on his gray head and murmured
words of comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have been very, very patient with her, dear, and
you were so right! She has had a terrible blow to her
pride, such as even the best of women could not bear with
patience. How then should she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cruel words from one’s child, my dear! Cruel words!”
said the suffering father, shaking his head without lifting it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was crazed by grief and shame. She did not mean
what she said. She did not even know what she said—did
not know it rightly, I mean! When she comes to her senses,
John, she will be more sorry and ashamed of her conduct to
you than she is now of her downfall, and she will be grateful
for your love and Christ-like patience with her. Her
present mood is hysteria—frenzy! Give her time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She threatened to go on the stage or on the street!” exclaimed
John, uttering the last three words with a deep
groan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She does rave worse than any other hysterical woman I
ever heard, to be sure, for, as a rule, they only threaten to
‘go mad’ or to ‘kill’; but it is all raving! there’s nothing in
it! You have been very patient and forbearing with your
willful and provoking girl in this time of her suffering and
excitement. Continue to be so, and you will have your reward
in her penitence and affection. Believe it, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Blessed are the peacemakers,’” quoted John Legg.
“Come and draw a chair and sit by me, Julia, my dear.
Your presence alone is very calming, even when you do not
speak, though your words are always good and comforting
and your voice sweet and pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia Legg seated herself beside her husband and took his
hand in hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia, having exhausted herself by her fury, fell down
again upon the sofa and buried her face in the cushions.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now in the silence that ensued John Legg became
conscious of a growing disturbance in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>This might have been going on some time unnoticed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>the three persons in the library, who were absorbed in their
own trouble; but now the disturbance on the opposite side
of the hall was too evident to be ignored.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sound of angry voices, hurrying steps and struggling
forms reached their ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia started up from her sofa and sat with her head
bent forward, staring in the direction of the noise and
listening intently, with a look of demoniacal satisfaction
and expectancy on her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia cowered and clung for protection to the husband
whom she herself had just been comforting.</p>

<p class='c009'>He patted her head to reassure her, and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, let me go, dear, and see what is the matter in
there,” gently trying to release himself from her clasp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, no!” cried Julia, clinging closer than before.
“Pray, don’t leave us, John! Don’t go into that room!
Something dreadful is going on there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment a piercing shriek rang through the air,
followed by a heavy fall that shook the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot stand this! Julia, I cannot stand it! I tell you
I must run and prevent mischief if I can!” he urged
earnestly, trying to free himself from her strong arms, but
finding that he could not do so without using force and
violence that must hurt her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The confusion arose to uproar. A loud crash shivered on
the floor, and a peal of fiendish laughter resounded through
the building, and a woman’s agonized cry went up to heaven
for help!</p>

<p class='c009'>Lamia, sitting on the sofa, leaning forward, listening intently,
now broke into a low, demoniacal chuckle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Julia!” exclaimed John Legg, breathing hard through
excitement. “I hate to hurt you, but I must prevent murder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he wrenched her arms from around his neck, threw
her back in the armchair and rushed from the library to the
drawing-room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI<br> <span class='large'>A TERRIBLE SCENE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We must now explain the cause of the parlor storm. It
came on in this way:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>All the guests of Haymore Hall—with the exception of
the Legg family in the library—were still assembled in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Campbell party, father, mother and daughter, still
occupied the obscure sofa against the rear wall of the back
division.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy and Will Walling were seated near, talking with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy, Mike and Longman were standing on the rug before
the fire, exchanging confidences on the affairs of the
evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff reclined, stupidly staring, on a divan in
the recess of the front bay window, and occasionally drew
from his pocket a large flask, which, with trembling hands,
he uncorked and put to his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran walked about from one group of friends to another,
trying to seem at ease, but too surely in a state of intense
anxiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he took heart of grace and went up to the group
on the sofa, touched the Rev. James Campbell on the shoulder
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come with me, please, reverend sir; I wish to consult
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector arose and drew the arm of his host within his
own and walked away with him. They did not leave the
drawing-room, but went slowly up and down its length for
the first few minutes in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran did not seem to know how to open the subject he had
on his mind. So it was the rector, after all, who, probably
divining the nature of his friend’s difficulty, was the first
to speak and to speak to the point.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The hour is late, and something should be done with
that——” He paused, unwilling to use the words that
arose to his lips, and he indicated the inebriate by a movement
of his thumb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Ran, “that is what puzzles me. It was of
that I wished to talk with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on then! Let me have your views. It is late, as I
remarked before, and I should have taken my wife and
daughter home an hour ago, but that I did not wish to leave
you until something should be settled in regard to this
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“But you will not leave us to-night? Rooms have already
been prepared for you!” exclaimed Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear young friend, I thank you heartily, for myself
and my womenkind, but we must return to the rectory to-night.
My daughter has left her young babe there,” replied
the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is so late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the distance is so short.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do oblige us by staying, Mr. Campbell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Mr. Hay, don’t you see it is impossible, much as
I thank you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am sorry. So will Judy be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now about the disposition of this—Montgomery?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” sighed Randolph Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you intend to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know, sir. I want you to tell me, if you please.
I might send for a constable to take him to the lockup
house, as they call it here; but I do not like to do that. I
might send him in a carriage to the village tavern, but I
think he would drink himself to death there; or I might
give him a bed here for the present, and indeed this is what
I would rather do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh—what? Keep the fellow here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the present, yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And in the name of common sense—why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, to keep him out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My good young friend, you did well to take counsel with
me. You would have done well to take counsel of any sane
man on such a subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I begin to suspect that you need a trustee for your
estate and a guardian for your person!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen, then! That fellow deserves to go to prison. He
might be sent to the village inn. But, my friend, he must
not be allowed to spend so much as one night under your
roof. To let him do so would be an act of insanity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For more reasons than one. In the first place, he is the
fraudulent claimant of your name and estate, though his
claim will not bear an instant of light, a ray of truth, let
in upon it; yet your allowing him to remain in the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>to which he came as its pretended master, would seem, to
him at least, to be giving some color to his pretensions. Do
you see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see what you mean, but I am not afraid of anything
he, poor wretch, may think or say or do. Is there any other
reason why he should not be sheltered here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—not so strong a reason, to be sure; but a most
decent one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is a bigamist. He came here bringing a cruelly deceived,
falsely married woman, who was never, therefore,
wife or bride. She, not ‘Mrs.’ anybody, but Miss Legg, is
here in your house under the charge of her parents, who are
your guests. Therefore it would be unseemly—to use the
mildest term—for him to remain under the same roof. Do
you see now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I see. How oblique one’s vision is at times,
however. Well, Mr. Campbell, you have told me what I
must not do with him; will you now tell me what I may?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. If your merciful spirit shrinks from passing
him over into the hands of the law, you can have him put
into a carriage and taken to the village inn—‘The Red Fox,’
Giles Scroggins, host.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will do so, and hold myself responsible for his expenses
there,” said Randolph Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then both men looked toward the divan in the front
bay window, on which lolled Gentleman Geff, very drunk
and getting drunker every instant, for he now had the big
flask turned up to his mouth, with his head thrown so far
back that he was evidently draining the last drop of its contents.
When he had done so, he made a futile attempt to restore
the empty flask to his pocket, but instead let it fall to
the floor, while he dropped back into his lolling position.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was at this moment that Clay Legg strode into the
drawing-room, fresh from his humiliating interview with
his father, smarting under the disclosure of his sister’s dishonor.</p>

<p class='c009'>He strode past all the guests in his way, and straight up
to the side of his late friend and patron, Gentleman Geff,
struck his hand heavily on the drunkard’s shoulder, shook
him roughly and said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“Do you know, you brute! you devil! what is before
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff opened his heavy red eyes and stared in
a deep stupor, through which fury began to kindle slowly,
like flame from under a thick smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Answer me, you beast!” demanded Legg, with another
and rougher shake of the wretch under his grasp. “Do you
know what is before you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! nor care!” roared the madman, with a perfect
stream of profanity and obscenity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then listen to me!” said Legg, when at length the torrent
from Tartarus was stayed. “What is before you is
first a trial for bigamy, with fourteen years of penal serviture,
with hard labor, bread and water, ball and chain, dark
cell and frequent flogging thrown in!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff answered this by a glare of hatred and
defiance and another inundation from the River of Styx.</p>

<p class='c009'>Legg waited until that flood was exhausted and then
added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor is that all! For when your first term of penal servitude
shall be served out, another indictment will await you
for conspiracy, perjury, forgery and fraud, by which you
sought to gain possession of the Haymore estate, and another
fourteen years, at least, of imprisonment, hard labor,
stripes, chains and the rest!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Gentleman Geff opened his lips in a way that made
his mouth seem the opening of the pit of fire and brimstone
for the blasting curses that issued from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>And again Legg waited in sarcastic silence until the
smoke and flame had sunk down, and then he added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you should live through your second term you will
have served twenty-eight years and you will be near sixty
years of age—a very hoary-headed sinner, indeed! And yet,
at the end of that time, the United States will want you on
a charge of highway robbery and attempted murder, and
will get you under the international extradition treaty.
And you will pass the remainder of your guilty life in an
American prison, where not only are the strong and rebellious
criminals compelled to labor, but the aged, the
infirm, and the invalids are scourged and driven to hard
work, until they drop dead (if all tales be true). ‘Do you
like the picture?’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>A blast of fury, profanity and indecency, more diabolical
than all that bad preceded it, stormed from the mouth of
the madman, and raved like a whirlwind around the ears of
the listener.</p>

<p class='c009'>When this had died of its own frenzy, Legg spoke again
and for the last time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know, you fiend, who are here? I will tell you!
The witnesses who will convict you of every crime known
to mankind. There on the sofa, at the opposite end of this
room, a little in the shadow, sits your wife, Jennie Montgomery,
whom you married, deserted and afterward stabbed,
and left for dead in the streets in New York. There she
sits between her mother and father, all three bent on prosecuting
you to the full extent of the law! Look attentively
and you will see them! There, talking with Lawyer
Walling, is Randolph Hay, your benefactor, who saved you
from starving and shared his hut with you in the mining
camp of Grizzly Gulch, and whom you robbed, tried to murder
and left for dead in the Black Woods of California so
that you might claim his name and place with impunity!
He will be compelled to prosecute you! And across the
hall, in the library with her father, is the woman you deceived
into a false marriage. She will prosecute you with
all the vim, venom and virulence of a proud, outraged and
revengeful woman. That is, if she does not prefer to execute
you with her own hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clay Legg should have known the dangerous wild beast
he was goading to madness, yet he went on with a strange
fatuity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff had followed with his eyes the index of
Clay Legg to the distant sofa, on which sat the wronged
wife, Jennie Montgomery, between her father and her
mother. He had slowly but surely recognized her, stared
at her in stupid dismay until he was again stung to fury
by the insulting words of Clay Legg, when he turned his
kindling eyes on the face of the man who was drawing such
a degrading picture of his fate. It seemed then that it
only needed the cessation of the sound of the speaker’s voice
to break the spell that held the demoniac; for no sooner had
it ceased than he sprang to his feet with a terrible roar
and hurled himself toward Legg.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the latter saw his peril with the speed of lightning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and fled away, leaving others to brave the storm he himself
had raised.</p>

<p class='c009'>In an instant the maniac was raging in the midst of “the
goodlie company,” and all was fear, panic and confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little Mike, unhappily, was nearest to the madman and
first to attempt to pacify him. But the demon caught up a
heavy astral lamp from the table nearest to him and shivered
it upon the head of the willing peacemaker, who fell
like a slaughtered sheep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy’s shrieks of agony rang out upon the air, and
brought the terrified servants to the drawing-room doors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The demoniac sprang upon the table and seized a heavy
chair, which he whirled around his head, threatening all
who approached.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Longman sprang upon the table and threw
themselves upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was at this moment that John Legg, startled by the
screams of the women, entered the drawing-room, through
the side door leading from the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, it was pandemonium that met the horror-stricken
eyes of the man. Can I possibly show you the scene as he
beheld it?</p>

<p class='c009'>As he stood in the doorway, on his left, near the bay
window in the upper end of the room, high on the table
stood the athletic form of the demoniac, raging and foaming,
cursing and threatening in the frenzy of <i><span lang="la">mania a potu</span></i>,
swinging aloft the heavy chair which he whirled around
his head with the swiftness and velocity of a windmill. On
the same table stood Samson Longman and Randolph Hay,
struggling to master the maniac, who seemed possessed of
the strength of seven devils.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the floor, near the middle of the room, lay Michael
Man, stunned by a wound in his head, prostrate and insensible.
Near him were scattered the fragments of the astral
lamp that had evidently been the instrument by which his
skull had been fractured. Beside him sat Judith Hay, with
his wounded head on her lap. She was weeping and wailing,
giving full vent to her grief and horror after the manner
of her warm-hearted, impulsive race. Beside him on
the opposite side knelt the Rev. Mr. Campbell, with a bowl
of water and a napkin, washing the blood from the cut.</p>

<p class='c009'>Away back in the lower end of the long room, on a shady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>sofa, sat Mrs. Campbell and her daughter, Jennie Montgomery,
clasped in each other’s arms, with their heads hidden
on each other’s shoulders, too much shocked, horror-stricken,
terrified to help, to speak or even to move. From
under the same sofa peered the pallid face and staring eyes
of Dandy Quin, who had evidently sought that lowly refuge
“as the safest place at the crack of doom” for a poor little
old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither Clay Legg nor Will Walling were to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this, which has required some time to describe, was
taken in at one view by John Legg. And for one instant
he stood in doubt where first to offer help; whether to jump—but
no; honest John’s jumping days were over—whether
to scramble up on the table and help to subdue the maniac
possessed of a legion of devils, or to kneel down by the side
of the minister to serve if he could the wounded man. In
another moment the doubt was decided for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran succeeded in getting both his hands around the
throat of the demoniac, which he held as in the grip of
death, while Longman wrenched and twisted the heavy,
murderous missile from his hands and dropped it on the
floor and then closed with him in a conquering clasp. But
it took all his strength, as well as all of Ran’s, to hold the
infuriate, now that his arms were free.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feeling sure that the maniac was conquered, John Legg
turned his attention from the scene of conquest on the
table to the scene of suffering on the carpet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the young man dangerously wounded?” he inquired
in a low tone of Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We hope not. We hope this may be only a scalp wound.
But it will be impossible to tell until there is a surgical examination,”
replied the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has a doctor been sent for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; Mr. Walling has gone out to dispatch a servant for
Mr. Hobbs, the village practitioner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, me poor Mike!” cried Judy, breaking afresh into
sobs and tears and dialect. “Me poor, dear, darlint bhoy!
Sure he was born to have the head av him broke. Sure, it’s
not the first time, though it’s the worst. But, afther all,
it is not so bad broke as me own dear Ran’s was, be the
same token, and be the hands av that same murthering thaif
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>av the wurruld! Oh! wirra! wirra! It was not enough
that he kilt me dear Ran intirely, but now he must kill me
poor Mike!” wailed Judy until her words were drowned in
a flood of tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell gazed in astonishment for a moment. In
this wild Irish girl, giving full swing to her emotions and
her brogue, he could scarcely recognize the quiet gentlewoman
he had known now for some hours as Mrs. Randolph
Hay. But he quickly recovered himself, and atoned for his
involuntary rudeness by withdrawing his gaze and offering
the gentlest words of consolation.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime the struggle on the table was continued
in grim silence. The opponents saving all their wind for
their strife until, as they swayed back and forth, the equilibrium
of the board was overbalanced, and table and men
fell together to the floor with a loud crash that called forth
shrieks from the women.</p>

<p class='c009'>For one moment the three men rolled together in a knot
on the carpet, and the next Gentleman Geff lay flat on his
back, with Longman’s knees on his chest and hands around
his throat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ran!” exclaimed the hunter, “take my handkerchief out
of my coat pocket and tie the feet of this wild beast!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran immediately tried to obey. He drew the large red
bandanna from Longman’s pocket, found it strong enough
for its purpose, and went around and took hold of the feet
of the prostrate madman, but he immediately received a
shower of kicks upon his chest that knocked him breathless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seeing that, Longman raised his voice again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Legg, come here! We haven’t got a man to deal
with, but a devil, and a rum-maddened devil at that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Legg immediately rushed to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you got a scarf or a handkerchief? A good strong
one. All right! Tie this brute’s fore paws together while
I hold him down. Samson, my namesake, what amazing
strength rum and madness gives a brute!” panted Longman,
when he had finished his labor and arose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conquered demoniac lay bound and gagged on the
floor, his murderous limbs helpless, his blasphemous tongue
speechless. Yet still he writhed, tossed and floundered like
some huge, stranded sea monster.</p>

<p class='c009'>The distressed group gathered around Michael Man were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>obliged to wait in quietness for the arrival of the doctor,
for they dared not even move the wounded man lest they
should do him a fatal injury.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Hobbs came at last, and being a country practitioner,
he brought his medicine chest as well as his surgical case
with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a tall, lank, red-haired young Yorkshireman,
fresh from the London colleges, who had lately succeeded to
the practice of his father, an aged, retired physician of the
place.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found two patients to be treated, one in as dire need
as the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>But after hearing a brief account of the occurrence from
Mr. Randolph Hay, he gave his first services to the youth,
Michael Man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bleeding wound in his head was of itself bringing
back the consciousness of the wounded lad.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Hobbs knelt by his side and made a careful examination
of his injuries, and then he told the anxious friends
that they were not dangerous, only a deep scalp wound and
a very slight fracture of the skull.</p>

<p class='c009'>He washed and dressed the wound there on the spot, and
then directed that the youth should be taken to his room,
undressed and put to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A narrow mattress was brought by two menservants, who
laid it on the carpet, lifted the wounded youth tenderly, laid
him on it and so bore him out of the drawing-room and up
the grand staircase to his chamber on the third floor, followed
by Dr. Hobbs and Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time Michael Man was carefully undressed and
comfortably settled in bed he recovered his faculties sufficiently
to recognize the situation and speak to those around
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t ye be frighted, Judy, darlint,” he murmured
feebly to his pallid, distressed sister, who was bending anxiously
over him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, and I’m not, Mike, dear. Yourself will be all
right soon,” she replied, putting much constraint upon herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Troth, and I’m all right now. So the redskins did come
and attack the fort, afther all. But the colonel was aquil
to the blackguards,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>And then the doctor perceived that he was becoming delirious,
and he administered a sedative. When the patient
had grown quiet again the doctor left him, with his sister
Judy sitting by his bed, and went downstairs to the drawing-room
to attend to the other case waiting for his treatment.</p>

<p class='c009'>There he found the demoniac still lying on the floor,
bound hand and foot. Longman, Dandy and Mr. Campbell
were standing around him. They had taken the gag from
his mouth, but he was breathing heavily. He had suffered
the usual reaction in <i><span lang="la">mania a potu</span></i>, from violent frenzy to
deep coma.</p>

<p class='c009'>The men around him made way for the young doctor,
who knelt down beside him, looked into his face, felt his
pulse and his heart, and even lifted the heavy, half-closed
lids of his swollen eyes. Then he rose and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you may unbind him with safety now; he will
not be in a condition to assault any one or do any harm for
many days to come, if he ever should.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment Ran re-entered the drawing-room and reported
Mike as sleeping quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, in the kindness of his heart toward his fallen foe,
he stooped and examined the condition of Gentleman Geff,
whom Longman had just unbound and straightened out,
and who was now lying relaxed and limp on the carpet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mr. Campbell,” said Ran, standing up, “you see
that we have no alternative than to put this poor wretch to
bed in the house here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so,” said the rector. Then turning to the doctor,
he inquired: “Will it be safe to remove this man immediately
to my house—to the rectory, that is? The distance
is short, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be perfectly safe, sir,” replied the physician.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, Mr. Hay, I shall be much obliged to you for the
use of a spring wagon or cart and a mattress with pillows
and proper covering to convey this man to the rectory,”
said Mr. Campbell, turning to his host.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear sir, do you think of what you are about
to do?” demanded Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; my duty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But your daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She need never see or speak to him or be troubled by
him. Jennie is a very sensible, practical young woman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>always was so, like her dear mother. And her misfortunes—the
result of her one act of imprudence—have made her
even more so. Jennie will be no hindrance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should you take so much trouble, make such
a sacrifice, assume such a responsibility as to carry this
stupefied madman to your quiet house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, as I said before, it is my duty. I am a minister
of the merciful Gospel, however much below that sacred
calling, and must set an example of charity—practice some
little of what I preach. The man is my daughter’s husband,
however unworthy of her; my own son-in-law, however discreditable
to me; and I must do my duty by him, however
disagreeable to us all. My dear wife and daughter will give
no trouble. There will be no scenes, no hysterics. They
are good, true, strong women, and will sustain me in my
action. But they need not go near the man. Longman, his
mother and myself can take care of him. And now, my
friend, will you order the conveyance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sigh and a gesture of deprecation, Ran went out
to give the necessary directions.</p>

<p class='c009'>There had been some delay caused by this discussion; but
it did not matter to the unworthy subject of it; he was lying
on the carpet in a dead stupor, and for himself was as well
there as anywhere else: so there was no hurry.</p>

<p class='c009'>In less than half an hour a light spring cart, such as is
used by expressmen, was brought around from the stables.
It was drawn by two horses and furnished with comfortable
bedding, and to this receptacle Gentleman Geff was conveyed
in the arms of four men.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector and the doctor rode on the seat with the driver,
and they took the road to the rectory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Campbell and her daughter, declining all Mr. and
Mrs. Hay’s pressing invitations, set out in one of the Hall
carriages for their home. Longman rode on the box with
the coachman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Walling, old Dandy and the Legg family were the
only remaining guests at the Hall, and these declined to retire
to bed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>It was of no use to go to bed. The sun was rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy, leaving Mike fast asleep, came downstairs, summoned
the housekeeper and gave directions for an early and
ample breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she went into the library to look after the Leggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>She found Lamia lying on the sofa with her face buried
in the cushions. She lay perfectly still, so that she might
be asleep, ashamed or only sulky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Legg lay back in her easy-chair, fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg sat in the great leathern armchair, with his
hands clasped upon his knees and his chin bent upon his
chest; he was awake, as deep sighs showed him to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Clay Legg was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy was so calm and reassured now that, without once
falling into dialect, she addressed herself to the old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Legg, there have been bedrooms at the disposal of
yourself and family all last night. I hope the servant,
whose duty it was to do so, has not failed to let you know
this or to offer to show you to your apartments?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, madam, thank you. No one has failed to execute
your hospitable orders; but who could go to bed in such a
night as has been passed? No, madam; just as soon as my
wife and daughter are a little rested we shall bid you good-by
and take our leave of your hospitable home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry that such is your resolution; but as soon as
Mrs. and Miss Legg shall awaken I hope you will ring a
bell and a servant shall show you to your rooms, where, at
least, you may have the refreshment of the toilet service before
breakfast,” concluded Judy, pleased with her victory
over the brogue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind, madam, and we will avail ourselves
of your offer,” said John Legg, with a bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy smiled and left the library.</p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner had the door closed behind her than Lamia
reared her head like a serpent from the sofa and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, ring the bell now. I am awake, at any
rate, and I should like a bath and then breakfast to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>room. I shall not go down to the breakfast table to face
a sneering pack of hypocrites.”</p>

<p class='c009'>John Legg sighed and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The commotion waked up Mrs. Legg, who yawned, rubbed
her eyes and looked about her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are we? What place is this? How came we
here?” she muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she suddenly recollected the situation and circumstances
and added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s well I’m strong. John Legg, how have you stood
it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As well as man could, Julia, I hope. But here is a
young woman come to show us to our rooms, where we can
wash our faces before breakfast,” he added, as a housemaid
appeared at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three arose and prepared to follow the girl, who led
them up the first flight of stairs to one of the best suites of
rooms in the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>When John Legg and Julia Legg had made their simple
and hasty toilet, they went downstairs and into the drawing-room,
where they found Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay, Mr.
Will Walling and Dandy Quin awaiting them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They greeted the party, and then John Legg apologized
for the absence of his daughter as best he could.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy excused herself for a moment and went out immediately
to speak to the housekeeper and order an excellent
breakfast sent up to Miss Legg in her room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she returned to her guests and conducted them to
the breakfast parlor, where the morning meal was already
laid.</p>

<p class='c009'>After breakfast Mr. and Mrs. Legg took leave, and with
old Dandy, who wept at parting with his friends, and with
their daughter, closely veiled and silent, left Haymore Hall
in a carriage proffered by Ran and drove to Chuxton, where
they took the train for London, en route for Medge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Clay Legg had not been seen since he had fled from before
the face of the frenzied Gentleman Geff. He was afterward
heard of in Wales, as a hanger-on to his father-in-law, under
whose protection his wife and children had lived for some
time past.</p>

<p class='c009'>Michael Man’s good constitution, excellent health and
temperate habits were all so much in his favor that in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>few days he began to get well, and before the week was out
he came downstairs and joined the family at their meals.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector came over every day to inquire after Mike and
to bring reports of Gentleman Geff, who was at death’s door
with brain fever and not expected to recover. Longman,
the colossus, was established in the sick-room as his constant
attendant. Elspeth remained at the rectory for the
present. She would not leave the family under present circumstances.
Meanwhile Randolph Hay had given orders to
his bailiff, Prowt, to have the gamekeeper’s cottage put in
complete repair and refurnished for the Longmans.</p>

<p class='c009'>Christmas came, and the young couple at the Hall sent
invitations to their few intimate friends to come and spend
the sacred festival with them. They were loyal to the humblest
among these. They really invited not only Mr. and
Mrs. Campbell and Mrs. Montgomery and Dr. Hobbs, but
old Dandy from Medge and Longman and Elspeth from the
rectory. Will Walling and Michael Man were still staying
in the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young doctor, the rector and his wife and daughter
accepted the invitation, but Elspeth and Longman declined
it on the ground that she would have to stay at home to
mind the baby and he to attend to the sick man; but these
were not the only reasons; they both felt that their presence,
as even Christmas guests at the Hall, would be a social solecism;
for as Elspeth said to her son:</p>

<p class='c009'>“These generous young people from the woods of a foreign
country don’t know what they are a-doing of when
they invite you and me to dinner, Samson! It might do
well enough in the mines of the backwoods. But here!
Why, bless ’em, if they go on in this way not a single soul
among the country families will have a thing to do with
’em, if they are the lord and lady of the manor! But they’ll
find out better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman fully agreed with his mother, and so he wrote
his excuses for both.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Dandy Quin also wrote from Medge and begged to
be excused on two pleas: the first that he was not able to
make the long journey from one end of England to the
other twice in ten days; and the second was that he wanted
to eat his Christmas dinner with his new-found relatives.
He added the information that he did not mean to carry out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>his first intention of buying an annuity with his savings,
but that he should go into partnership with his nephew, and
that in the spring they should move into a larger house and
increase their business.</p>

<p class='c009'>He concluded with a piece of news that made Ran, Judy
and Mike break into one of their shouting Grizzly Gulch
laughs.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wrote that poor Miss Lyddy Legg—and just think of
the queenly and beautiful Lamia Leegh being called “poor
Miss Lyddy Legg!”—was very broken-hearted, though she
need not be, for it was not her fault that she had been
taken in by a false marriage; and that everybody was as
kind to her as kind could be, and that he himself—Dandy
Quin—had so much respect and sympathy for her that he
offered to marry her out of hand and make an honest woman
of her and leave her all his property at his death! but that
the poor, misguided and demented young woman, who did
not know what was for her own good, had refused him with
scorn and insolence. There!</p>

<p class='c009'>Think of the vain and haughty Lamia Leegh receiving an
offer of marriage from Dandy Quin!</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding, or perhaps because of these “regrets,”
Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay enjoyed their Christmas with
the few friends who gathered around them.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the morning they walked to the village church in company
with Will Walling and Mike. They heard a good
Christmas sermon from the Rev. Mr. Campbell and listened
to some really fine music from the organ and grand anthems
from the choristers.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the service they shook hands with the rector and
his wife and daughter and with Elspeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman was at the rectory keeping guard over the dying
man.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay entertained at
dinner the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, Mrs. Montgomery,
Dr. Hobbs, Mr. Will Walling and Mr. Michael Man. And
the festival passed off pleasantly, nor did Judy, nor even
Mike, once fall into dialect.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Christmas holidays were over, Mr. Will Walling,
having seen his friend and client, Mr. Randolph Hay,
in quiet and undisputed possession of Haymore, prepared
to take leave of the Hall and return to New York.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>A few days before his expected departure he called Ran
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what are your plans?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall not leave Haymore until the spring,” replied
Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, give me half an hour in the library alone with
you. I have something to talk about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran followed his guest to the room of books and gave
him a chair and took another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, however, instead of seating himself, Mr. Will Walling
went to one of the book shelves and took down a large,
heavy volume bound in red cloth and gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This,” he said, as he laid it on the table and turned over
the leaves, “is the last year’s edition of ‘Burke’s Landed
Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” carelessly inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this,” continued the lawyer, as he paused at an
open page, “is the genealogy of the Hays, of Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” again inquired Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you to look at it with me. I don’t wish to bore
you to go over the whole history, with its marriages, births
and deaths, but only to notice this fact that runs through
the whole, from your first known ancestor, Arthur Hei, who
married Edda, a daughter of Seebold, Earl of Northumberland,
down to your grandfather, the late squire, who married
Gentil, daughter of Pharoah Cooper, of Esling. Moor,
Yorkshire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was a gypsy, and the child of a gypsy,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; still she is set down here as the daughter of a certain
somebody. All your ‘forebyes’ have married the daughters
of certain somebodies, from dukes down to gypsies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, but what does all this talk tend to?” demanded
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To this: It is too late for your name as Squire of Haymore
to appear in this year’s edition of the ‘Landed
Gentry’; the volume is probably already issued. But before
long the <em>Herald College</em> will be getting up next year’s edition,
and you will receive letters or messengers inquiring for
authentic statistics concerning your succession, marriage
and so on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, they can have them,” said Ran indifferently.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Yes, but I am afraid there will be some awkwardness for
you on one point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which point?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That of your marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How should that be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, in this way—listen. The items of entry in your
case will be something like this:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Hay, Randolph; born July 15, 184—; succeeded his
grandfather as tenth squire, March 1, 186—,’ (for you know
that your succession will date from the day of his death);
‘married December 2, 186—, Judith, daughter of ——’
Whom? There’s where the awkwardness would come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would say simply—Judith Man,” replied Ran Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well—Judith Man, daughter of—whom? The
<em>Herald’s College</em> are very precise in these matters. You
will have to find a father for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Walling! If you were not my friend and my guest,
I should be very angry with you. My sweet wife is a child
of the Heavenly Father! but for an earthly parent of either
sex I do not know where to look.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here then, Hay, to me. I didn’t mention the difficulty
without having a remedy for it. I am a childless
widower, as you know. And though it would be straining
a point of probability to represent a man of thirty-seven
as the lawful father of a woman of nineteen, still I would
like to adopt your wife as my daughter, that she may be
entered in the Red Book as Judith, daughter of William
Walling, Esq., attorney-at-law, New York City. Come,
Hay, my friend, you know I mean the best by you and by
her. Now what do you say to accepting me as your father-in-law?”
inquired Will Walling, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Randolph Hay paused before he replied. He was more
pained than pleased. Yet he appreciated the lawyer’s good
intentions, and was grateful for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you from my heart, Mr. Walling, for your intended
kindness; and I feel grieved that I cannot accept
your gracious proposal, since not to do so must seem so very
ungracious as well as ungrateful to a friend whom I love
and esteem as much as I do you. And yet I cannot accept
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why not?” inquired the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“I—do not know. I cannot tell. I have a feeling against
it which I am unable to define or analyze.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am not. I know the cause of your reluctance. It
is because it would not be strictly true. That is it. You
need not answer, Ran, my boy. But you must allow me to
tell you that you are a little too scrupulous for a practical
world, though I do not like you the less on that account,”
said Will Walling, with his usual little laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I hope my scruples, as you call them, will not affect
our friendship?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have just told you that they will not. There, let the
matter drop!” concluded the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy never heard of the offer Mr. Will Walling had made
to adopt her as his daughter for the sake of giving her a
good antenuptial position, nor did she ever guess that there
would be any awkwardness in the record of her marriage
in the Hay, of Haymore, item of “The Landed Gentry of
Great Britain and Ireland.” She was not troubled on that
subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the affairs of the Hays were so satisfactorily settled
now that the young couple were only waiting for the departure
of Will Walling to leave Haymore for London,
where they might live in retirement in that great city until
they should have fitted themselves to mingle with the more
critical of their Yorkshire neighbors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early in the new year pleasant letters came from America.
They were from Cleve and Palma Stuart, and brought
news of the change of fortune that would take them to the
mountain farm of West Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Judy were pleased, yet puzzled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should have thought, if they left New York, they
would have gone to that fine plantation in Mississippi,” said
Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So should I, and not to what must be a poor farm on
the mountain,” added Ran. And then turning to Walling,
he added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see you will have to take the documents, putting
Palma in possession of the property I have made over to
her, all the way to West Virginia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will do that with pleasure. I have never yet seen
the Alleghany Mountains,” replied Will Walling, who was
always ready to travel over any new ground.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>It was nearly the first of February that Will Walling at
length reluctantly made up his mind to take leave of his
friends at Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>In bidding them farewell he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot help regretting that you would not accept me
for your father-in-law, Hay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran only laughed in reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he mean by asking you to be his father-in-law?”
inquired Judy, after the dogcart that was taking Will
Walling to the station had rolled away from the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, only his nonsense. You know, of course, that, as I
have no mother nor he any daughter, he could never have
been my father-in-law,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Judy never suspected how it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>But before many months Judy and Mike were claimed by
a father with a pedigree which the most heathenish worshiper
of rank might have been proud to acknowledge.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br> <span class='large'>HOPE AND LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Poley, dear darling, will you go with Cleve and me to
West Virginia to live?” exclaimed Palma, running into the
cabinet kitchen of her flat, where good Mrs. Pole was busy
over the fire, baking those very muffins in which she so excelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve had gone out to change the bonanza check to pay
the rent and to give up the flat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poley paused, with a spoonful of batter held in her hand,
halfway between the bowl on the table and the muffin rings
in the pan on the range.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is that you said, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma repeated her question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will I go with you to Vest Wirginny? That’s the furrin
nation we was to war with, ain’t it?” inquired Mrs. Pole,
going on to fill her muffin rings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mention the war, Poley. I cannot bear to talk
of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Well, I won’t. But that Vest Wirginny—where is it?
In New Orleenes?” inquired Mrs. Pole, whose ideas of
geography were so vague that she once asked Palma if
Africa was in the United States. And Palma, to spare the
good woman’s self-esteem, answered that Africans, or their
descendants, had been in America for a couple of centuries.
Whereupon Mrs. Pole had added that, of course, she knew
that America was in the United States. Palma had not set
her right, but ruminated in her own mind on the fact of the
future when our national New Jerusalem would not make a
part of the Western continent, but the Western continent
would be only a part of the grand republic of the planet
Earth. But this is a digression. Now to return.</p>

<p class='c009'>“West Virginia is much nearer than New Orleans,” replied
Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole filled the last of her muffin rings and set the
pan containing them on the range before she spoke again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you and Mr. Stuart be going there to live, ma’am,
you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, yes—and very soon, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole put the bowl of batter in the cupboard, covered
it over with a clean napkin and sat down, “to save her
back,” while her muffins were baking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For good?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed, for good in every sense of the word, I do
hope and believe. I will tell you all about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole jumped up and ran into her little bedroom adjoining
the kitchen, and brought out a small, low-backed
rocker, saying to her little lady:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! Sit ye down while you talk. You have often
enough told me to ‘spare my back’ whenever I could lawfully
do so. And now I tell you to spare your own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma laughed and dropped into her chair, and when
Mrs. Pole had looked at her muffins and seen that they were
doing well, and taken her own seat on a cane chair, Palma
began:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell it to you as Cleve told it to me, for it is like
a story, Poley. Here goes!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Once upon a time there was an old man—a very rich
old man—who lived in an old stone house at the foot of a
mountain, called Wolfscliff, and the woods that clothed the
side of the mountain were called Wolfswalk, because, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>the land was surveyed and the first house was built there
was neither sleep by night nor safety by day, for the wolves.
They carried off hens and geese and sheep and calves, and—horror
to relate!—even the little negro babies. This was
how the place received its name. The wolves were worse
than the Indians. They could neither be fought off nor
bought off, but had gradually to die off, like the Indians.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So the name came down the generations to the time of
Jeremiah Cleve, the old man with whom my story commenced,
and who lived in an old stone farmhouse in the
woods at the foot of the mountain—a house many times
larger than the log cabin of his first American ancestor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This Jeremiah had married an heiress in his own neighborhood,
and so had doubled his fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They had three sons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“John, the eldest, was, according to the law of primogeniture
then prevailing in Virginia, heir to the landed estate
of his father. This John, when he was but twenty years
of age, became engaged to be married to the beautiful
daughter of the man who owned the nearest plantation to
Wolfswalk. It was a long engagement, on account of the
young fiancée’s extreme youth; but just when they were
going to be married, when he was twenty-five and she was
eighteen, she caught a severe cold while out sleighing with
him, and died within a week of inflammation of the lungs.
She was buried in her bridal dress, on her wedding day. It
is said that on her deathbed he solemnly vowed himself to
her, lover and husband, for time and eternity. That was
seventy years ago, and he has kept his faith. He is now a
lonely old man of ninety-five, the solitary master of Wolfscliff,
waiting for the Lord to call him to join his bride in
heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The younger sons, Charles and James, were, by the
terms of the marriage settlements of their parents, co-heirs
of their mother’s estate; and if there had been ten, they
would have all been equal co-heirs, and each portion small;
as there were but two, each portion was considerable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Charles was the first of the family to marry. He wedded
a young woman of family and fortune, and went to live on
his mother’s plantation. They had two sons. When these
boys were old enough to be sent to college their mother
sickened and died of typhoid fever, how contracted no one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>ever could tell. Their father never married. His house
was well managed by a capable young mulatto woman, who
made it homelike to the boys when they came there to spend
the vacation. At length, when the young men were relatively
twenty-two and twenty-four years old, their father
also died, and the young men lived on the farm like true
brothers until the Civil War broke out, when they entered
the Southern army. Ah! poor, dear, brave boys! One fell
at Fredericksburg, the other at Cold Harbor. Truly ‘The
glory of this world passeth away.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“I come now to the youngest of old Jeremiah’s sons—James,
who was Cleve’s grandfather—his mother’s father.
He had a passion for the military life, and he entered the
army. When he had gained his commission as second lieutenant
of infantry, he married Molly Jefferson, a relation
of the illustrious Thomas.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By this time the aged couple, Jeremiah and Josephine
Cleve, had passed on to a higher life, and John, their eldest
son, a man passed middle age, reigned at Wolfscliff in their
stead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“John, a lonely man, invited the young couple to make
their permanent home with him, and they did so until the
Mexican War broke out, when the young lieutenant had to
follow Gen. Scott to Mexico. His young wife would gladly
have accompanied him ‘even to the battlefield,’ but she was
then nursing her first—and only—child, a baby girl not a
month old, when the young husband and father went away
to the war, from which he never came back again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The tidings of his death in the battle of Chepultepec
came to Wolfscliff as a death blow to the youthful widow.
She pined and died within the year, leaving her infant
daughter, Cara, to the charge, yes, rather to the heart of
John Cleve. He brought up and educated the orphan and,
when she was grown, went out into the world for her sake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a winter they passed in Washington they met young
Mr. Stuart, of the Cypresses, Mississippi. A mutual attachment
between the young people was approved by John
Cleve. And the next summer Mr. Stuart, of Mississippi,
and Miss Cleve, of Virginia, were married at Wolfscliff.
They went on an extended wedding tour which filled up all
the summer and autumn months, and only returned to the
husband’s home in Mississippi in time for the Christmas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>holidays, when they were joined by John Cleve, of Wolfscliff,
who came at their—not invitation only, but prayer—to
spend the winter with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was his first and last visit—not that he had not
enjoyed it, nor that he ceased to love his dear niece, but
that after her marriage he grew more and more of a recluse,
a student and a dreamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she visited him all the more frequently that she
could not induce him to leave his home. Instead of going
to a gay summer resort when she migrated to the North
every summer, she would go to Wolfscliff, until at length,
when years passed and children came every year, and sickened
every year, and she had to take them to the seaside,
her annual visits to Wolfscliff were discontinued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cleve, the youngest child, and the only one who survived
his parents, was taken to Wolfscliff when he was
about three years old. That was the first and last time he
ever saw his grand-uncle. Of the tragic fate of Cleve’s
father and mother you have heard me tell, Poley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” answered Mrs. Pole; “they were fatally hurt
on the wreck of the <em>Lucy Lee</em>, I remember.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And after that, do you know that the aged John Cleve,
of Wolfscliff, who sank deeper and deeper into solitary study
and reverie, utterly lost sight of his grand-nephew, whom
he was contented to think of as at school under the supervision
of his guardian, Judge Barrn, or at college, or traveling
in Europe, or on his Mississippi plantation, not knowing
that the latter was a charred and blasted ruin and desert
until the death, in battle, of his last nephew left him without
an heir bearing the name of Cleve. Then he instituted
inquiries for his grand-nephew, Cleve Stuart, but without
the least effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Accident at last revealed Cleve’s residence in New
York. Mr. Sam Walling went to Washington on legal business
and fell in with a Mr. Steele, of Wolfswalk, the nearest
town to Wolfscliff, and, in the course of conversation, mentioned
the sage of Wolfscliff and his vain quest for his
nephew and heir, Cleve Stuart. Then Mr. Walling gave
information, and the West Virginian went back to the
mountains with the news the hermit was pining to hear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“John Cleve immediately wrote the letter inviting Mr.
Stuart and myself to come and make our home with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“And you are going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I told you so. Will you come with us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the end of the world. To the jumping-off place.
And even there, if you should take the leap in the dark, I’ll
jump down after you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Poley, I am so glad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And why should I stay behind? And why should I not
go? I have nieces and cousins here, to be sure; but they
are all doing well. And though I love them, I think I love
you more, for you do seem more like a child of my own than
any of them do; and you seem to want me more than they
can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do want you more, Poley, darling. And Cleve is so
anxious for you to go with us for me. Though I am now in
excellent health, he seems to think I require a nurse to look
after me as much as if I were a sick baby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so you be, my dear, for this present time, and will
be for some time to come,” Mrs. Pole replied, nodding
wisely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am so glad you will come, Poley, dear. And listen.
When I get settled at Wolfscliff next summer you can invite
any of your relations, or all of them, as many as the
house will hold, to come and stay with you. It will be such
a pleasant, healthful change for them, from the crowded
city to the fine, open mountains.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be heaven for them to see it only for a day.
Why, we all went up the North River and saw the hills only
from the deck of the steamer, and they thought that was
paradise, and longed to be in it. What would they say to
staying a week among the mountains?” exclaimed Poley.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then they shall come. They shall all come,” responded
Palma delightedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear child, what would the old gentleman say?”
demurred Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Poley, you don’t know the Southern people. Neither
do I, for that matter, except upon Cleve’s showing. But I
am sure I can guarantee you and yours a welcome at Wolfscliff.
And mind, we won’t have to send to market for meat,
poultry and vegetables, nor to the grocer’s for flour, and
meal, and lard, and eggs, and such things. Nearly everything,
except tea and sugar, pepper and salt, and such, are
produced on the farm, and cost next to nothing,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Palma, speaking as she believed and proving how little she
knew of the cost of labor or the worth of time on a farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mrs. Pole, who was as ignorant of such a life as was
her youthful friend, received every statement in good faith,
and anticipated good days to come.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked once more at her muffins, made the tea, and
then went into the parlor to set the table for luncheon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma went into her bedroom to overhaul trunks and
bureau drawers, to see what she could make of her scant
wardrobe, in view of appearing among strangers in West
Virginia. She had but three suits—the superb velvet dress
given her by Mrs. Walling, which she thought could only
be worn on grand occasions, and must be quite useless in
the mountain farmhouse; the well-worn crimson cashmere
now on her back, and in its very last days; the fine India
muslin, now fairly embroidered, not with unnecessary fancy
work, but with needful darns. These were all the dresses
Palma owned, if we except the old, faded blue gingham
wrapper in which Cleve had first found her in her garret.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must get Poley to sponge and press the crimson cashmere,
and then that will do to travel in, and with care it
may last the rest of the winter,” she said patiently, as she
locked her trunk and her bureau drawers and returned to
her little parlor, where she sat down to work on a doll’s
dress, or what might have passed for such.</p>

<p class='c009'>While thus engaged she sang a sweet nursery song that
was a reminiscence of her own infancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Cleve came in, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, dear,” he said, “I have paid the rent and given up
the rooms, though I had to pay another month’s rent in
lieu of a month’s warning; and I have settled every other
outstanding bill except the milkman’s. I could not find
man or bill if I tried, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; there is no bill. We buy tickets, and pay cash, and
we have seven tickets left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the man can have the benefit, for we go away to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From the city?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; from the flat. We will go to a hotel to-night, and
go to Washington to-morrow, en route for West Virginia.
Can you pack up in that time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can pack up in an hour,” replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>As she spoke the hall boy knocked and entered the room,
showing in a man with a bundle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! that is all right, thank you—that will do,” said
Stuart as the man set down the box and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is my new business suit for winter wear in the mountain
farmhouse. What do you think of it, Palma?” he inquired,
cutting the twine and unpacking the box and shaking
out a suit of brown beaver cloth, consisting of double-breasted
coat, vest and pantaloons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I think it is excellent. Such a rich, deep color, and
such soft, thick, warm material,” said the young wife appreciatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, so it is—all that,” added Mrs. Pole, who was setting
the tea urn on the table. “But, la! what a blessing it
is that women’s clothes grows on ’em, like feathers do on
to a bird, so they never has no trouble nor expense to buy
any.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart dropped his suit on the floor and looked at his
wife in dismay, noticed her faded, shabby cashmere dress,
and became contrite for his thoughtlessness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lunch is ready, ma’am,” and hurried out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mind Poley, Cleve, dear. She is full of queer sayings,
you know,” said Palma conciliatingly. “Come now,
and sit down to luncheon. Here are some of her nice muffins.”
And she took her seat at the table and began to pour
out the tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been an idiot, and a very selfish idiot at that!
providing myself with a first-rate suit of clothes, and even
displaying them to your admiration, without once remembering
that you also would require raiment. I am obliged
to the woman for bringing me to my senses,” said Stuart
as he took his seat opposite his wife and helped himself to
a muffin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense, Cleve! I have got a tongue in my head, and
if I had wanted anything would have asked you for it without
hesitation,” replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fear you would not have recognized any want, my
dear; and I fear it is true that some men are so thoughtless
that they act as if women’s clothes grew on them like the
petals of a flower, and cost neither money nor effort to renew.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>But I see now. Yes, dear rose of my life, I see your
petals are fading.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No more was said until after luncheon, when Cleve put a
fifty-dollar note in Palma’s hand and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go out and get what is necessary for your comfort, my
dear; and take some lady friend with you, for I fear you
have very little experience in shopping.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Cleve,” replied Palma, laughing; “but I
shall take Poley. She will be a better judge of what I need
than any of our fine lady friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, perhaps you are right,” admitted Stuart, and the
discussion ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mrs. Pole had cleared away the table and taken her
own luncheon Palma invited her to go on a shopping expedition;
and they put on their bonnets and outer garments
and started. Palma’s was only the plush jacket that belonged
to her cashmere suit, and she shivered so much as
she walked that Mrs. Pole said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very first thing that you must buy must be a heavy
cloth coat. You can get one for twenty dollars. I should
prefer a Scotch plaid shawl, but young people don’t wear
such things now, only neat-fitting coats, or sacques, or dolmans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They went down on Broadway and into store after store,
trying where they could find at once the cheapest and the
best.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length Palma was suited with a close-fitting heavy
cloth coat that not only satisfied herself but also Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, as you like it so well, keep it on, child, and
have your plush jacket done up in a parcel and I will take
it home,” said the good woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>And this was done.</p>

<p class='c009'>But then they went to the suit department, where Palma
selected an olive-green pressed flannel dress for herself, and
had to take off her coat to try it on. Then she bought a
beaver bonnet and a leather hand-bag, and her shopping was
complete.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole, who had saved up the wages she had received,
bought a very heavy tartan shawl, two pairs of thick yarn
stockings, a pair of stout goat-skin boots, a pair of warm
woolen gloves, and a thick green berege veil, and felt herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>provided for defense against the winter on the mountain
farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached home they found Stuart waiting for
them. He said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray do not trouble to get dinner this evening, as we
can dine at the hotel where we are to spend the night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad of that, on Poley’s account for she is
very tired. She insisted on bringing home all our purchases
herself, and just look how she has loaded herself
down!” said Palma, laughing, though, in fact, the two
heaviest items of the purchases, namely, Palma’s beaver
cloth coat and Poley’s tartan shawl, were worn home on the
shoulders of the respective owners.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I must beg you to pack up as soon as possible, and
I will help you, if you will show me how,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That would be an awful hindrance, sir! Just let me
get my breath for a minute and I’ll be all right. I am not
tired one bit. And we’ll get through the packing in a jiffy!
It’s very easy to move when there’s no furnitur’, and nothing
but one’s clothes and things to pack,” said Mrs. Pole,
sitting down on the first chair, dropping her bundles on the
floor, and untying the broad plaid ribbon strings of her big
black straw bonnet.</p>

<p class='c009'>She kept her word, for in five minutes she was on her feet
again, and in less than an hour the trunks were packed,
locked and strapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart wrote the labels and pasted them on the tops, and
they stood ready for the expressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the three put on their outer garments and turned to
leave their flat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma paused and looked back half regretfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by, pretty little home,” she said. “We have been
very happy in you, but you must not mind our going away.
We shall have to go away from our bodies some of these
days! But I hope you will have very pleasant tenants always.
Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart did not laugh at her, but Mrs. Pole did, and said
as they went to the elevator:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I didn’t know you as well as I do, child, I should
really sometimes think you were crazy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Poley! don’t you know there is a soul in places and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>in things, as well as there is in all other living creatures?”
she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole did not reply, but thought within herself: “I
do suppose as there be some of the sensiblest people crazy
in spots.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They went down in the elevator; and what a misfit of
words there is in that sentence!</p>

<p class='c009'>They found the janitor waiting in the office to see them
off. Mr. Stuart gave him the key of the vacated apartments,
and they all shook hands with him and left, with the request
that he would see to the delivery of their trunks to the
expressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they walked down the street to the corner of the
avenue where the cars passed. Mr. Stuart hailed the first
down one, and they boarded it. They rode about the length
of twenty blocks, got off and walked across town to Broadway,
and entered the office of the hotel that Stuart had
chosen for their sojourning place that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were easily provided with rooms.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Palma had taken off her bonnet in her chamber
Mrs. Pole, who still stood up in her street costume, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, ma’am, if you please, I must leave you for a little
while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, Poley dear! Is there any more shopping to do?
Have you forgotten anything?” demanded Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my child! But as we are to start to-morrow morning
I must go and take leave of my kinfolks to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Poley! And they live away downtown somewhere!
And—you can never go alone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, child? I have been used to go alone all about
the city all the days of my life, even when I was a young
woman, and nothing ever happened to me, or even threatened
to happen to me! And if nothing didn’t in my youth,
nothing ain’t like to do it in my age! Don’t be uneasy,
child! I’ll be back by ten o’clock, and one o’ my nephies
will see me here safe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But won’t you wait until after dinner? Cleve says they
keep a sumptuous table here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I hope you will get the good of it, my dear, but
as for me, I must hurry away. I’ll make up for missing of
my dinner by eating a hearty supper when I come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take care, you must not risk a return of those horrid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>nights you had at Lull’s, you know,” said Palma, with a
sudden recollection of the sleep-walking and magpie-hiding
propensities that had been features of those disturbed
nights, though features that happily Mrs. Pole had never
suspected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t you be afraid! It was the cold, heavy pastry
that did it at Lull’s! There was no basket beggars to
carry off the cold pie crusts and puddin’s, and me and the
girls used to eat ’em all up at night to keep ’em from being
wasted on. And I never heard of their hurting anybody but
me, either. But don’t you be afraid. I shall eat nothing
but the very best of nutericious and digesterable food, like
stewed oysters and sich.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Poley. Eat what you will, so it shall agree
with you. And now don’t fail to invite your relations in
my name as well as in your own to come to Wolfscliff to
see you next summer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, ma’am, for reminding me again. Now I
know you are in airnest and I’ll be sure to invite them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Poley, I am always in earnest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure, I know you are, ma’am, dear child,” answered
Mrs. Pole, divided in her style of address, between
her respect for her mistress and her tenderness of her pet.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then again she took leave and went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve came out and escorted Palma down to dinner,
where the many and slow courses occupied them for more
than an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>At ten o’clock Poley punctually made her appearance,
and ate a hearty supper of stewed oysters and brown stout
with her nephew.</p>

<p class='c009'>At eleven o’clock the whole party retired to rest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIX<br> <span class='large'>TO THE MOUNTAIN FARM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>They rose early in the morning, breakfasted and drove
down to Cortlandt Street ferry to take the boat for Jersey
City.</p>

<p class='c009'>They caught the eight-thirty train in good time and without
hurry.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Stuart found their baggage all right, waiting for them,
checked it to Washington, and then entered with his companions
into the ladies’ car, and the express train started on
its Southern flight. Their journey was quick, pleasant and
uneventful.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early in the evening of that day they reached Washington.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving their trunks in the baggage room at the depot,
and taking only their hand-bags, they went to one of the
best hotels, where they dined and engaged rooms for the
night and the next day.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was Palma’s first sight of the capital of her country,
and Cleve determined to linger a few hours to show her the
public buildings.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Stuart engaged a hack and took his
two companions for a long, circuitous drive, which should
include visits to the White House, the State, War, Navy and
Treasury Departments and the Capitol. But these visits
were necessarily short. There was no time to pay their respects
to the President in the Executive Mansion, or to
listen to the debates in the Senate Chamber or in the House
of Representatives, or to the cases in the Supreme Court.
They had to get back to lunch and then to take the train for
West Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two o’clock in the afternoon found them again seated in
the cars and flying westward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to this hour the day had been clear and mild, but
now the sky began to cloud over, and when they reached
Alexandria the snow began to fall, and as they left the old
town behind them and the short winter afternoon drew to a
close, the storm thickened, if that could be called a storm
in which there was no wind, but a cataclysm of snow falling
directly, silently and continuously upon the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Strange scenes were traced on the window panes without,
weird, beautiful, fantastic scenes—cities, palaces, gardens,
trees—all drawn in frosted silver. They fascinated the imagination
of Palma, who was never tired of gazing and
dreaming. Little or nothing could be seen through the
storm of the country over which they were flying.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached Oaklands, on the Alleghanies, late at night.
They had taken through tickets to the end of their railway
journey, and the train was going on that night; yet, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>storm continued, they determined to lay over until the next
morning. Leaving their trunks on the baggage car to go on
to their destination, they took their hand-bags and walked
through the thickly falling snow to the hotel, where they
were comforted by clean rooms, glorious hickory wood fires,
and a delicious supper of venison steaks, broiled ham, buckwheat
cakes, hot rolls, tea, coffee, and rich cream, and butter,
and honey such as is seldom found anywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>It had been a fatiguing day, and as they could see nothing
of the country for the snowstorm, they all went to bed and
slept the sleep of the just.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning they rose to a new life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The storm had ceased. The sky was clear, and the sun
was shining over a splendid, a magnificent, a dazzling world
of mountains, valleys, fields and forests, all arrayed in white
and decked with diamonds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Cleve,” cried Palma, looking out from the upper
window of her bedroom, “does it seem possible that only
yesterday we were in a crowded city, not two hundred miles
away, and that now we find ourselves in this magnificent
scene? Why, Cleve, yesterday seems to be a thousand years
behind, and this to be another planet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her rhapsodies were interrupted by the breakfast bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>And for all answer Cleve smiled, drew her arm within his
own and led her down to the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were some few other wayfarers present in the
room, and these men were standing around the great, roaring
wood fire and talking politics or crops. But they soon
left their position and sat down at the board. Mrs. Pole was
there, too, ready to join her friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever dream of such a world as this, Poley?”
whispered Palma as the three sat down in a row, Palma
being in the middle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, never in all my life! I never even ’magined as there
could be such a place as this! And, oh! ain’t it cold,
neither?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cold, but such a fine, pure, healthy cold. And the hot
coffee will warm you, Poley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The breakfast was in many respects a repetition of the
supper, and in all respects equal to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seems to me I eat twice as much at every meal as I
ever eat before in my life, and yet I feel hungry in an hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>after I have finished. I do believe if I was to live up in
these regions I should have such an appetite I should think
of nothing but eating and drinking from morning till night,
and dreaming of nothing but eating and drinking from
night till morning!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder how long that would last?” queried Palma,
but Mrs. Pole did not answer. She had turned her attention
the the venison steaks.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as breakfast was over the three put on their outer
garments and walked through the main street of the mountain
town to the railway station, where they had to wait
for nearly half an hour for the Eastern train to come in.
Then they took their seats on board of it, and were once
more flying westward through the magnificent mountain
world in its splendid winter garb of ice and snow.</p>

<p class='c009'>All day long our travelers reveled in the glorious panorama
that flew past the windows of their car, until night
closed in and hid the scene from their vision.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite dark when they reached the little way station
of Wolfswalk, where they left the train, which stopped
half a minute and then sped on westward.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was too dark for our party to see anything but the few
glimmering lights at the station and in the stable yard of
the village tavern on the opposite side of the road, and the
ghostly forms of the mountains looming through the obscurity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is now seven o’clock, and we are three miles from
Wolfscliff Hall. I shouldn’t wonder if we have to spend
the night at the inn here,” said Cleve Stuart as he drew the
arm of his wife within his own and prepared to cross the
country road, or village street, as you may prefer to call it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the inn is anything like that of Oaklands I shall not
be very sorry. Come on, Poley. Keep close behind us,”
said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Scuse me, marster; is you Marse Cleve Stuart?” inquired
a voice from the darkness at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Who are you?” demanded Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Sias, sah, old Marse John Clebe’s man f’om Wolfskif;
yas, sah, dat’s me,” replied the invisible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you have been sent to meet us, eh? Come in here.
Let us take a look at one another,” said Cleve with a laugh,
as he led the way into the lighted station.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>The negro was a man of middle age, tall, stout, strong
and very black, and clothed in a warm suit of thick, heavy
homespun cloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have been sent to meet us?” again suggested
Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas, sah! along wid de ox cart, to fetch you an’—de
ladies, do’ I did’n know as dere wasn’t no more’n one lady;
but, laws! de more de better, I say, marster, and my name’s
’Sias, old Marse John Clebe’s man f’m Wolfskif Hall—yas,
sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you say you had brought the ox cart for us?” inquired
Stuart in some dismay as he thought of his dainty
wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas, sah! I has fetched the ox cart, wid Baron an’
Markiss yoked on, an’ dey is de best beasts on de plantation,
kind and gentle as new milk, ’specially Baron, to fetch you
an’ de ladies and de luggage, all at de same time, an’ dere’s
a-plenty o’ hay for de ladies to sit on jes’ as clean an’ as
dry n’s sweet as wiolits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But was there no carriage in my uncle’s stables?” inquired
Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plenty. But, Lor’, marster, dey was one an’ all so ole
an’ rusty, an’ flip-floppy, an’ ramshakelly, dat dey couldn’t
be trusted on good roads in good wedder by daylight, let
alone bad roads in bad wedder by night. An’ wot is
true ob de kerridges mought be said ob de hosses, likewise.
Dey wouldn’ be sho-futted on sich roads in sich wedder at
night. De ox cart is de mos’ safes’ an’ de oxes is de mos’
sho-futtedes’. An’ yo’ wouldn’ like to hab de ladies’ necks
broke for de sake ob pomps an’ wanities in kerridges!
Would yo’ now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve laughed, but Palma put in her word:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cleve, I’m delighted! It is so new! such fun! to
ride on the hay in an ox cart! It seems so of a piece with
all our strange experiences! Yes! this is some new planet!
Not our old familiar earth!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you happen to be here to meet us? We are a
day and a half behind time,” inquired Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ole Marse John Clebe, ob Wolfskif Hall—an’ I am his
own man ’Sias, wot nebber would ’mancipate him in de ole
ages ob his onnerrubble life fur all de President an’
Con’gess might say—telled me to come yere to meet yer an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>stay for de las’ train till you ’rove, an’ dis is de mos’ secondes’
day as I hab been yere to meet yo’! An’ now, young
marse, ef yo’ll listen to me, yo’ll put de ladies in de cart an’
we’ll jog off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, ’Sias. Show us the way to the chariot,”
laughed Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>The negro set his lantern down in a chair, took from it a
bit of candle, which he lighted by a match and replaced,
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I shows the way, young marster,” and walked out
of the station, followed by Stuart, Palma and Poley.</p>

<p class='c009'>He led them to the lower end of the platform near which
the ox cart stood, with its floor thickly carpeted with layers
of hay, and with its yoke of oxen standing and pawing in
the cold night air. Their heads were turned away from the
town, as if all ready for their jog across the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart put Palma upon the cart, and she settled herself
in the hay with childish delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he helped Mrs. Pole to a seat beside her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Marse Glebe, ef yo’ will jes’ git up dar on
dat bench, in front ob de two ladies, yo’ll obleege dis compinny!
’Caze, yo’ see, I’s got to walk at the head ob de
creeturs to keep ’em straight on to de road.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that necessary?” inquired Stuart as he climbed to his
place and settled himself comfortably.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘N’essary?’” exclaimed ’Sias. “Why, la, bress yer soul,
Marse Clebe! dere’s places ’long dis road w’ere ef dis yere
nigh beast was to make a misstep, we’d all go ober down
free fo’ hunderd feet to the rocks below. No, sah! I’s
gwine walk at dis creetur’s head and carry my lantern, too,”
concluded ’Sias as the oxen moved slowly and heavily onward
as was their manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lantern might have been, and probably was, a help
to the vision of ’Sias and so to the safety of his party, but
it could show only a small section of the road immediately
under the feet of the conductor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing could be seen of the surrounding country except
that it consisted of densely wooded mountains, whose skeleton
trees were faintly outlined against the ground of snow.</p>

<p class='c009'>When their eyes grew accustomed to the darkness the
travelers in the cart could see, to their horror, that they
were plodding along a rough and narrow road between a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>high rise of rocks on their right and a deep fall on their
left; but the cautious negro guide with his lantern walked
by the heads of the oxen between them and the precipice,
keeping them out of the terrible danger. For an hour their
way lay along this road, and then began slowly to descend
a gradual slope, and finally turned to the right and entered
a thick wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Sias heaved a deep sigh of relief and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Peoples sez, w’en dey gits out’n dif’culty an’ danger, as
dey’s ‘out’n de woods.’ But, la! I allers feels as if I wasn’t
safe until I was offen dat dar debbil’s shelf, up dar, an’ got
down yere in dese woods.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far are we from the house, ’Sias?” inquired Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On’y ’bout a mile, young marster. Get dere werry soon
now. Dis yere is all ole Marse John Clebe’s lan’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas, sah. An’ dis woods usen to be called Wolfswalk
in de ollen times, I’s heern says, ‘cause dar was mos’ as
many wolfs as trees, an’ de station ober yonder was just
named arter dese yer woods, an’ dats de trufe for a fac’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They jogged through the dark, mysterious-looking woods
for some time in silence, Palma only once murmuring:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is like a dream, or a scene in a fairy tale. I feel as
if we should come upon something soon—an ogre’s castle,
an enchanted beauty’s palace, or something. Don’t wake
me up, please, anybody.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What they did come upon very soon was a glimmering
light, that seemed to shoot here and there through the thick,
leafless trees like a firefly, had it been summer instead of
winter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a lamp in de big hall; it shines right froo de fanlight
ober de front do’, an’ it seems to flit about so ’caze
sometimes de trees sho’ it an’ sometimes dey doan’t,” ’Sias
explained. And as he spoke the ox cart slowly and clumsily
drew up before a large, oblong building of the simplest and
plainest style of architecture common among the wealthier
class of that region at the time the house was planned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though the travelers could not, at that time of night,
discern its features, yet this seems the best time for their
historian to describe it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house was built in the rude, strong, plain style of the
best old colonial mansions, of rough-hewn gray rocks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>every variegated shade of red, blue, green, yellow, purple
and orange, which gave a mosaic aspect to the walls. It was
an oblong double house, with a broad double door, having
two long windows on each side of the first floor, and five
windows on the second floor, surmounted by a steep roof,
with five dormer windows, and buttressed by four huge
chimneys, two at each gable end. There were many old oak,
elm and chestnut trees around the dwelling, and there were
smaller houses, of rude construction, in the rear.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the ox cart stopped before the door Stuart got off
his seat and lifted down his wife and her attendant. He
tucked Palma’s hand under his arm and led her up the few
steps that went up to the front door. That door was open
and full of light from a large lamp that hung from the
ceiling of the spacious hall, and within the door stood the
master of the house to welcome his coming relatives.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a man of middle height—the thinnest, whitest,
most shadowy living man they had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are welcome to Wolfscliff, my dears,” he said, giving
a hand each to Palma and to Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are very glad to see you, uncle,” said the two in
one breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this lady?” said the old-fashioned gentleman, with
native courtesy as he held out his hand to Mrs. Pole, of
whom he had just caught sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our friend, Mrs. Pole, who never leaves Palma, uncle,”
explained Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I am glad to see you, ma’am,” said Mr. Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir. I am only Mrs. Cleve Stuart’s housekeeper
and attendant,” said Mrs. Pole, who would not consent
to seem a half an inch above her real social position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! And a very trusted and esteemed friend, also, I
have no doubt,” replied the old gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is, indeed, sir, like a mother to my delicate Palma,”
assented Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad she consented to accompany you here,”
said Mr. Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the moment they stood there talking Palma took in
with her eyes the whole of the spacious hall. It ran from
front to back through the middle of the house, with double
doors at each end, four doors on either side and a broad
staircase going up from the midst. A hat rack and half a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>dozen heavy oak chairs were the only furniture. There was
no carpet on the polished oak floor, no pictures on the
paneled wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you come into the parlor, or would you prefer, first,
to go to your rooms?” inquired the old gentleman, opening
a door on his right.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which would you rather do, Palma?” inquired Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, go into the parlor! You see, uncle, we have not
come through dust, but through snow, and we are as clean
as when we had washed this morning,” replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man led the way into a large, square room, with
paneled walls, polished floor, heavy walnut chairs and
tables, and a broad, open fireplace, with brass andirons, on
which was piled about an eighth of a cord of blazing hickory
logs. Around this was a brass fender; above it, on the wall,
a handsome carved oak mantelpiece surmounted by a broad
mirror, and down before it on the floor a rich old Turkey
rug. Two large armchairs stood in each chimney corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dears, and you, ma’am, make yourselves comfortable
and be quite at home. Supper will be ready in a
few minutes,” said Mr. Cleve as he sank into one of the
armchairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Palma saw how fragile he really was—his transparent
face was as white as ashes, his thin hair and thin
whiskers were like floss of silver, his hands were the longest,
thinnest, fairest hands ever seen. He was clothed in a dark
blue dressing-gown which he folded double over his knees,
and the bald spot on the top of his head was covered with
a much worn old blue velvet skullcap. His aspect suggested
frost, cobweb, chrysalis. Only his deep-set, soft brown eyes
shone warm and bright with the fire of life, light and love
from the true soul, so slightly held by the fragile frame
and almost ready to fly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXX<br> <span class='large'>THE MOUNTAIN HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Cleve stretched out his hand and pulled the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>An elderly colored woman came in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Serve the supper in here, Polly. The dining-room is
too cold, I think,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“Yes, marster,” the woman replied and went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is in the northwest angle of the house, and has four
large windows—two north and two west—which shake and
rattle, and let in the wind when it blows, as it does now,
from that quarter; and also sends the smoke in volumes
down the chimney. So I think it will be more comfortable
for us to eat supper here,” Mr. Cleve explained as he bent
forward and spread his thin, fair hands to the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure there could not be a pleasanter room than
this,” said Palma from her low rocker as she basked in
the warm glow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah-h-h!” added Stuart with a sigh of deep satisfaction
as he rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman soon came back with faded felt crumb cloth
in her arms, which she went on to lay down on the shining
oak floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was followed by a colored girl with the table damask
in her hands. Between them they set the table, adorning it
with rare old china and antique silver. And then a good
supper, in honor of the new arrivals, as well as in consideration
of the weary and hungry travelers. There was tea,
coffee and chocolate, milk, cream and butter, rolls, waffles
and cakes, ham, poultry and game, eggs, cheese and fruit—variety,
without superabundance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Cleve arose and invited his relatives to take their
seats, and himself led Palma to the head of the table, saying
pleasantly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is your place henceforth, my child—a place that
has not been filled since my dear niece, your husband’s
mother, married and left me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma raised and kissed the pale hand that led her, and
then sat down before the tea tray.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old gentleman sat opposite to her at the foot, Stuart
on the right and Mrs. Pole on the left side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The venerable master of the house asked the blessing, and
the feast began. The two colored women waited on the
table—the elder one stood beside Palma to hand the cups;
the younger beside Mr. Cleve, to pass the plates. Varied
and appetizing as was the supper, the host partook but
daintily, contenting himself with a cup of cocoa and a
wafer. But Cleve and Palma had healthy young appetites,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and so delighted the hearts of the waiting women with their
appreciation of the good things set before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the meal was over and the table cleared of the service
the elder woman set a lamp upon it; then brought the
family Bible and laid it open where the place was kept by
her master’s spectacles as a book mark.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my dear children, let us draw near to Our
Father,” said the patriarch. And once more they gathered
around the table, on this occasion for worship.</p>

<p class='c009'>John Cleve read the first chapter of the Sermon on the
Mount; then made a pause, that all might reflect on the
divine lesson; next led in the evening thanksgiving and
prayer, offering up on this occasion especially grateful acknowledgments
for the dear children sent to be a comfort
to his declining days, and prayers for their spiritual and
eternal welfare. Then he pronounced the benediction, and
the evening service was over.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as they arose from their knees the elder colored
woman, whom her master had called Polly, came up to
Palma and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, ma’am, if you would like to go to your room now
I am ready to wait on you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you. I should like to retire,” replied wearied
Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ de oder lady, likewise,” added the woman, nodding
toward Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’m sure she would. She is even more fatigued
than I am—than either of us,” replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’ich it is her age-able years, ma’am, of coorse. She
can’t be as young as she used to be,” said the woman
gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably not,” admitted Palma with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The waiting woman lighted two short sperm candles, in
short brackets, and, with one in each hand, prepared to
lead the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we bid you good-night, uncle, dear?” inquired
Palma, going to the side of his easy-chair and bending over
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may, my dear, and your friend; but I must have
ten minutes’ talk with your husband here before I let him
go. I will not keep him longer than that,” replied the old
gentleman benignly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“Good-night, then, uncle, dear,” she said, raising his delicate
hands to her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless you, my love,” he responded, drawing her to
him and leaving a kiss on her forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, sir,” said Mrs. Pole with a formal bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, ma’am,” replied Mr. Cleve, lifting his
skullcap and bending his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma and Poley followed the colored woman out of the
parlor into the big, bare hall, up the broad stairs to the
upper hall, which was quite as big and as bare.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was bitterly cold. With a heavily wooded country, with
forests of pine, oak, cedar, hickory, chestnut, poplar and
other timber, on the slopes and in the valleys, and with
mines of coal among the rocks and caverns, it seemed yet
impossible to keep a country house of that region warm in
winter. You might keep certain rooms within it warm,
but not the halls and passages, not the whole house, for the
reason that they had no system of furnaces, registers, heat
pipes and so forth; but then they were considered all the
more wholesome on that account.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, Palma shivered and shook as with an ague
when she stepped upon the upper landing of the second
floor hall. It was almost exactly like the hall below; four
bedroom doors flanked it on each side, and there was a large
window at each end, corresponding to the front and back
door of the under one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly led them about halfway up the hall toward the front
of the house, and paused before a door on the right hand,
about midway, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here is yer room, ma’am, and the most comfortablest
one in the whole house, ’ceps ’tis ole marster’s, which is
downstairs, on t’other side ob de hall, behine de parlor, an’
befo’ de kitchen, and ‘tween ’em bofe, is sort o’ fended an’
warmed, and purtected by bofe sides habbin’ ob a big fire
into it, bofe day an’ night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She opened a door and showed them into a spacious chamber,
warmed and lighted by a great fire of hickory logs in
the ample chimney, which was directly opposite the door by
which they had entered. Tall brass andirons supported the
blazing logs, an antique brass fender and crossed fire-irons
secured the rich Turkey rug and the polished oak floor
from danger by falling brands or flying sparks; a carved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>oak mantelshelf surmounted the fireplace and supported an
oblong mirror, with a tall silver candlestick at each end.
There was a high window on each side of the fireplace, but
both were closed now, sash and shutter, and the snowy
dimity curtains were dropped. At the end of the room
nearest the front of the house stood a large, four-post bedstead,
with high-tented tester, from which hung full, white
dimity curtains festooned and looped from ceiling to floor.
Beside this white “marquee” lay a small Turkey rug.</p>

<p class='c009'>A chest of drawers, a walnut press, a corner washstand
and two easy-chairs draped with white dimity completed
the furniture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That little door, ma’am,” said Polly, pointing to one in
the wall opposite the foot of the bed, though a good distance
from it, “leads into a d’essin’-yoom, where you can
also keep yer extry clothes and fings as yer wouldn’t like to
clutter up yer bedroom wid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” said Palma, dropping into one of the easy-chairs
and beginning to unbutton her own boots.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait, ma’am. Let me. Please let me. I’ll just show
this lady here to her yoom, and then come and take off your
shoes for you!” exclaimed Polly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she put one of her candles on the chest of drawers,
and retaining the other, turned to Mrs. Pole and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, ma’am, please I’ll take yer to your yoom. It’s
just across the hall yere, right opposide to dis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanky,” replied Mrs. Pole. “I’ll go and find out
where it is, and much obleeged to you. But then, dear, I
will come back and stay long o’ you until Mr. Stuart comes
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right, Poley, dear,” replied Palma, who by this
time had got her boots off and her slippers out of her hand-bag
and onto her feet, and was sitting before the fire with
her toes on the top of the fender.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly took Mrs. Pole across the hall to the opposite room,
which as to size, windows and fireplace, was exactly like
that of Palma’s, except that it had a northern instead of
a southern aspect, and was, therefore, somewhat colder. It
was also upholstered in curtain calico instead of white dimity,
and had a picture of the Washington family, instead of
a handsome mirror over the mantelpiece. But there was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>fine fire burning which filled the room with light and
warmth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, ma’am, if yer want anything as I can get
you——” began Polly; but Mrs. Pole interrupted and dismissed
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; thank you. Good-night,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Polly left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pretty soon Mrs. Pole recrossed the hall and re-entered
Palma’s apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has the colored woman gone at last?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Poley. But what is the matter, dear? I do believe
you are jealous of that poor creature,” said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I am not; but I don’t like to be waited on and
fussed over so much. I don’t myself! It is all wrong and
on false grounds. They treat me here just as if I was a
lady and——” began Mrs. Pole, but she in her turn was
interrupted by Palma, who said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poley, dear, they treat you as a respectable woman, and
as they treat all respectable women—that is, all respectable
white women. You are to be our housekeeper and, as such,
one of the family. Don’t ‘kick against the pricks,’ Poley,
dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I kick against anything? If you knew the stiffness of
my joints through sitting so long in the cars you wouldn’t
be talking of me and kicking in the same breath,” said
Mrs. Pole with an injured air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ringing steps, attended by shuffling feet, were heard coming
along the hall, and then the voice of Cleve Stuart saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will do, ’Sias! Thank you. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the shuffling feet went back and the ringing steps
came on, and the door opened and Cleve Stuart entered
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, good-night, dearie, I’m gone. Good-night, Mr.
Stuart,” said Mrs. Pole. And rising from the second easy-chair
into which she had thrown herself she nodded and left
them, regardless of Stuart’s good-natured protestations that
she must not let him drive her away.</p>

<p class='c009'>All our tired travelers “slept the sleep of the just” that
night.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Palma, she knew nothing from the time her head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>touched her pillow until she opened her eyes the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>The room was dark, or lighted only by the red glow of
the hickory wood fire, and it was silent but for an occasional
crackle of some brand that was not of hickory, but of some
more resinous wood that had found its way in among the
harder sort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart was not by her side, nor anywhere in the room.
Evidently he had got up and dressed and left while she still
slept soundly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma crept out of bed and crossed the floor to open the
window, but as she did so the chamber door was opened
and the younger of the two negro women came in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Mornin’, ma’am,” she said brightly, smiling and showing
her teeth. “I was jes’ waitin’ outside o’ de do’ fo’ yo’
to wake up, to come in an’ wait on yo’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must have good ears,” said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Middlin’. But w’en I heerd de planks in de flo’ creak,
den I knowed yo’ was walkin’ across. I did brung up a
pitcher o’ hot water fo’ yo’ an’ put it on de ha’rf—dar it is,
ma’am,” said the girl, and she stooped and took up the
pitcher and carried it over to the washstand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me your name,” said Palma softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hatty, ma’am,” replied the girl, smiling brightly. And
when she smiled it was with a brilliancy unequaled in
Palma’s experience of faces. Hatty’s face was of the pure
African type. There was not a drop of Caucasian blood in
her veins; but she was of the finest African type, with fine
crinkling, silky, black hair, with glowing black eyes, so
large, soft and shining that, with varying phases they might
be called black diamonds, black stars, or—when half closed
with smiles or laughter, and veiled with their long, thick,
curled, black lashes—sunlit, reed-shaded pools. Her nose
was flat; her lips large and red, and her teeth white as
ivory. And when she laughed she seemed to be a natural
spring of mirth all by herself. And she was almost always
laughing, often silently. Few could look on the happy face
of the child without smiling in response.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, Hatty, I am afraid I am late. I hope I have
not kept anybody waiting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl, who had gone to open the windows, turned and
answered shortly:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“Oh, Lor’, no, ma’am! De birds deirselves—w’ich it is
de snowbirds, I mean—ain’t been long up, an’ de sun hese’f
hasn’ showed ’bove de mount’in, dough he’s riz. See,
ma’am!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had drawn back the curtains and pulled up the shade,
and now she threw open the shutters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma came to the window and looked out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh! what a glorious sight! Yet, to be graphic, I must
compare great things to small, or at least illustrate the
former by the latter. The house from which she looked
seemed now to be situated in the bottom of a vast, deep,
bowl-shaped valley, its colors now, in midwinter, dark green,
with gleams of snow-white, the whole canopied by deep
blue, flushed in the east by opal shades of rose, gold, violet,
and emerald. The mountains loomed all around in a circle
of irregular peaks, all thickly covered with pines, cedars,
spruce and other evergreen trees, which grew closest at the
base and thinnest near the tops, which were mostly bare,
and now, in December, covered, with snow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking from the front window of her room Palma could
see but half the circle—the eastern half, made beautiful now
by the rising sun. The sun had not yet come in sight; but
even as Palma gazed he suddenly sparkled up from behind
the cliffs, gilding all the opal hues of morning with dazzling
splendor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what a happiness to live in a home like this!” she
said to herself; “how good one ought to be to become half
worthy of it! Oh, my! oh, my!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She heard voices speaking below her window. In the
clearness of the atmosphere she recognized them as her husband’s
and his uncle’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>The former was saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, they are not a bit afraid of you! They seem to
know you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! they do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the speakers became silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s ole marse, a-feedin’ ob de snowbirds,” Hatty explained.
“Ole marse is jes’ a angel, ma’am! He’s good to
eberybody an’ eberyfing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You love your master very much, then, Hatty?” said
Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lub him? Dat ain’t no word for it! ’Cause, yo’ see,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>ma’am, I lubs so many bodies an’ so many fings, too, even
down to red ribbins an’ cakes! But I puffickly ’dores ole
marse!” said the girl, smiling until her eyes closed and all
the lines of her features were horizontal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma had gone to the washstand, where now the sound
of splashing water prevented the hearing of any talk. Then,
while she was drying her face and neck, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run, Hatty, and take my traveling dress from the hook
in the closet, and carry it out and shake it, and brush it,
and bring it back to me. I won’t take time now to unpack
my trunks to get another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost before she ceased to speak the girl, glad to serve
her, had darted into the closet, seized the dress, and was
running off with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time Palma had dried her skin and dressed her
hair Hatty was back with the dark blue flannel suit, looking
as fresh as when it came out of Lovelace &#38; Silkman’s establishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as Palma finished her toilet she hurried downstairs
and was met at the foot by the aged master of the
house, who had just come in from his bird feeding.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wore a faded, dark blue dressing-gown, thickly
wadded, and wrapped closely about his fragile form. He
looked, if possible, fairer, frailer and more of a mere chrysalis
than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, my dear,” he said. “You have slept
well, I know, and have risen to a beautiful day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear uncle, and opened my eyes upon a beautiful
scene! Ah! what a happiness it is to live in such a lovely
place! How much I thank you for bringing us to such a
heavenly place!” said Palma, taking and kissing the pale
hand that he had laid in silent blessing on her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much I thank you for coming, dear child!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank us for coming into paradise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not paradise even in summer, when it is almost a
Garden of Eden in the dip of the mountains! But I hope
it will be a very happy home to you and yours. Remember
that you are mistress here, of a house that has not had a
mistress for more than thirty years, when my dear niece,
your husband’s mother, married and left it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I am your servant, uncle—your servant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>daughter, whose duty and delight will be to wait on you and
minister to your comfort,” murmured Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Breakfast is ready, ma’am,” said Polly, the elderly negro
woman, opening the parlor door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my dear,” said Mr. Cleve, drawing Palma’s arm
within his own and leading her to the room, where the table
was waiting and a splendid fire was burning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is Mr. Stuart and Mrs. Pole?” inquired Palma,
looking around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go find them, Hatty,” ordered the master. But as he
spoke Cleve entered the room by the side door and laughingly
greeted his wife with the ironical question whether
she was really “up for all day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should have waked me,” said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, he should not. I hold with the Koran and
‘never awaken a sleeper’ unless, indeed, the occasion is sufficiently
important, which it was not this morning,” said
Mr. Cleve as they all sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole came in, convoyed by Hatty, who had found
her upstairs setting Palma’s room in order, and had taken
upon herself to instruct the good old woman that “age-able
ole white ladies didn’t make up no beds when there was
colored young girls to do it for ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mrs. Pole had greeted the company and taken her
seat the master of the house asked the blessing and breakfast
went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the morning meal was ended and the table cleared
away Mr. Cleve said to Palma:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear, when you feel disposed call Polly to
show you all over the house. And you will make any alterations
you see fit, choose any rooms that you may prefer
for your private apartments, and make a list of any furniture
or household utensils that you may need or may
like, and they shall be bought. There is a good sleigh in the
carriage house. If you would like to take a drive, send
Hatty to the stables to tell Josias to clean it out and harness
the horses. Do whatever you like, my child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, dear uncle. I wish I knew what you would
like, and that I would do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would like you to be happy, my child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, then; thank you, uncle, I will,” exclaimed
Palma with a light laugh as she danced out of the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and tripped upstairs to her own chamber to begin the work
of unpacking and putting away her own and her husband’s
wardrobe, in which she was to be assisted by Mrs. Pole,
who soon entered the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never in her life had Palma been so happy, so lighthearted,
so contented with the present, so careless of the future.
Even in her bridal days, sickness and the shadow of
death had been about her and had sobered, if it had not
darkened her delight. But now every cloud was lifted; the
present was full of joy, the future full of glad promise, and
her own soul overflowing with thankfulness to the Lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole was almost equally enchanted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Poley, we have both reached a haven of peace and
safety that is like a heavenly rest. Let us be good and
obedient children to our Father and Lord. That is all we
can do to show our gratitude,” said Palma, who was kneeling
by the side of her great sea trunk, taking out clothing
piece by piece and handing them to her attendant, who was
standing before the bureau and who folded each article in
turn and put it away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Darling,” answered Mrs. Pole, “I do not think as ever
I did such a good and altogether profitable day’s work as I
did that precious day when I found you too ill to get out
of bed and not a single soul to take care of you; and when
I said to myself as the week’s washing at Wilton’s would
have to go with my week’s wages into the bargin, and to-morrow
would have to take thought for itself, according to
Scripture, for once, for I was bound to stop long o’ you
an’ nuss you. Lor’, child! I haven’t too often walked by
faith instead o’ by sight, but I did it that once, and lo and
behold! what’s come outen it! We have never parted from
that day to this, and here I am in my old age not only
comfortable, but luxurious pervided for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ‘cast your bread upon the waters and after many
days it has returned to you,’” said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, please the Lord, for the futur’ I do mean to try
to be a better woman,” said Mrs. Pole very earnestly.</p>

<p class='c009'>When their task was completed and everything was in
order, Palma dropped into an easy-chair, drew a deep
breath, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Poley, it is but eleven o’clock, and there are three
hours before Uncle Cleve’s early dinner at two, so, if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>like, we will send for Aunt Polly—all the colored women
who are past their youth are aunts, you know; everybody’s
aunts, Cleve says—we will send for Aunt Polly and get her
to show us all over our new little kingdom, this big, old
house—its dining-room, kitchen and pantry, its storerooms,
china and linen closets, its chambers, attics and cuddies, and
all. Will you come, Poley, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you tired to death and out of breath now? No,
my dear. No. You must not exert yourself one bit more
to-day. Now mind what I tell you, honey. It is for your
good and Its!” replied Mrs. Pole, with a solemn warning
shake of her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Poley, I will obey you. Cleve and uncle are
shut up in the parlor, talking business, I suppose, so I will
sit here and sew until dinner time, or until I am called,”
said Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole got up and went to the shelf in the closet and
returned with Palma’s workbasket, in which her sewing
was already neatly arranged, and set it down on the floor
beside its owner.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Palma selected a tiny, half-finished garment that
might have fitted a medium doll, and began to sew some lace
edging on it. And soon, in the gayety of her heart, she
began to sing at her work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole got her own basket of infirm socks and stockings
and began to darn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXI<br> <span class='large'>UNCLE AND NEPHEW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>While they were so occupied Mr. Cleve had closed the
parlor door, shutting himself in with his nephew for a long
talk over their past and present lives and future arrangements—though
the earthly future of the aged man would
necessarily be very brief.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old gentleman wished rather to hear than to talk,
and so he only briefly reverted to the main events of his
own life—his early disappointment in love when his betrothed
bride was taken ill and died a few days before their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>intended marriage, and was buried in her bridal dress on
her wedding day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet, no; she was not buried, only her left-off body was
buried. She lived! Oh! how vividly! how blessedly! how
potently she lives! And I shall soon see her again! After
seventy years, my boy! after seventy years! But what are
they, in view of the life everlasting?” said the aged man in
conclusion of this reminiscence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve Stuart made no reply, but pressed his uncle’s hand
in reverential silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the old man spoke of the nephews who had borne
his own name and expected to inherit his estate, but who
had both died, unmarried, of wounds received in battle.
Then he spoke of his long, vain search of his niece’s son,
Cleve Stuart, and of the chance by which he found him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, my boy, that I have found you, let me say
that I find you all that I could wish, and your young wife—charming!
But tell me about her, Cleve. Who is she?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Palma is the daughter of the late James Jordan Hay
and the granddaughter of the late John Hayward Hay, of
Haymore, in the North Biding of Yorkshire, England,”
replied Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—indeed! I knew the old squire. When I went to
Europe in my young manhood I reached England in the
autumn, and through a letter of introduction got an invitation
to Mr. Storr’s, of Hoxton, where I stayed for the
Melton hunts and met Mr. Hay, of Haymore. Yes, the
Hays, of Haymore, are an ancient, historical, almost, I
might say, an illustrious family. I congratulate you, my
boy, but more on the personal merit of your young wife than
on her family connections. Who represents the house now
at Haymore? Which of the three lads I found there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart, as briefly as possible, gave him the later family
history.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a fatality! All these fine boys to pass away in
early manhood! And the son of Cuthbert, the second
brother, you say, inherits the manor. I remember Cuthbert
well. He was intended for the church. They called him
Cuddie. Now, tell me how you came to meet Palma. She
was the daughter of the youngest brother, James, you say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; and after the death of her parents she was adopted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>by Judge and Mrs. Barrn, who were my guardians. I met
Palma in their house when I first went there to live, and so
knew her from her infancy up. I won her pure affection
then, and never afterward lost it, thank Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An excellent knowledge and a blessed beginning. Now,
tell me how it was you lost your Mississippi plantation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not lost it. It is legally mine, but of no more
use to me than would be so many acres of waste land in
the<a id='t302'></a> Sahara. The land is, indeed, a desert, and the buildings a
mass of charred ruins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Through the war?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course. Mansion house, stables, barns, mills,
negroes’ quarters fired and burned to the ground; stock all
driven off; negroes conscripted. The place is a ruin and a
wilderness; it would take many thousand dollars to reclaim
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man sighed, but made no reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Stuart told him frankly of the desperate straits to
which he had been reduced at the time when his uncle’s
letter came to him so opportunely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Cleve was shocked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I had known! If I had only known!” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in all his narrative Stuart never mentioned the name
or existence of either Lamia Leegh or Gentleman Geff. It
was bad enough, he thought, to trouble the old gentleman’s
calm spirit with the tale of want; but it would have been
far worse to have darkened and depressed it with the story
of falsehood and treachery.</p>

<p class='c009'>The early dinner bell brought the family together, and
around the table were only happy faces. All the painful
past was for the time forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>The afternoon was beautiful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The large old sleigh was brushed out, lined with buffalo
skins and blankets, and brought around to the front door by
two swift horses. And the four—Mr. Cleve, Mrs. Pole,
Stuart and Palma—took a ride; the first pair seated on the
back seat, the second on the front seat, and Josias, the
coachman, on the box.</p>

<p class='c009'>They took the road that skirted the base of the mountains,
on the inside, and went in a circle around the plantation.
On this road, under the shelter of the mountains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>stood the negroes’ quarters—log huts, large and small, from
one room to two, three or even four, according to the necessities
of the occupants. The men and boys were all away at
such farm work as the season permitted, and the women
were engaged in washing, ironing, cooking, or carding and
spinning wool. Their open doors showed their occupations,
and showed also the bright pine wood fires that so warmed
their huts as to permit these open doors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sleigh passed too swiftly for the party in it to return
half the nods and smiles with which their passage was
greeted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle,” said Palma, “you appear to me like a patriarch
of old living among his tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear child, with this exception—the patriarchs
were men of large families, with many sons and daughters,
and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and innumerable
grandchildren and great-grandchildren to the third and
fourth generation, to rise up and call them blessed. And
I—have none.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! uncle, dear, you have us. We love you; indeed, we
do. And we will serve you as tenderly and devotedly as
any children could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it, my dear; I know it. And I thank the Lord
for sending you to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I thank the Lord that you let us come. And, oh!
uncle, I wish we could multiply ourselves into a tribe of
many generations to serve and bless you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All in good time, my little love; all in good time,” said
the old man with a twinkle in his glowing brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three miles’ circuit of the road was completed, and
they reached the house just as the winter sun was winking
out of sight behind the western peak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first day the ground will admit of walking I shall
go on foot to make the acquaintance of all your interesting
people, Uncle Cleve. I liked the glimpses I got of them as
we flew by,” said Palma as she gave her hand to her husband
and sprang out of the sleigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my child, so you shall,” replied the old man as he
in his turn alighted with the assistance of both Stuart and
Palma. “So you shall, my dear. And there are some few
neighbors and some distant relatives of ours with whom you
must soon make acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“Who are they, uncle, dear?” inquired Palma as she entered
the house on the old man’s arm, followed by Stuart
and Mrs. Pole, while ’Sias drove the sleigh around to the
stables.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell you presently, dear,” replied Mr. Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the hall Palma laid off her fur cloak and hood and
gave them to Hatty to take upstairs. Stuart helped his
uncle off with his overcoat and muffler.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had all returned to the oak parlor, where the
great fire had been replenished, and were seated around the
hearth enjoying the glow, and while Polly was passing in
and out setting the tea table, Mr. Cleve said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have no very near relations left in this world. We
who sit here are the nearest of kin to each other. Still, you
know, Virginians are as clannish as highlanders.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed. I remember that much of my beloved
mother. No matter how distant the relationship or how
humble or even unworthy the individual, my dear mother
always held sacred the claims of kindred. My poor father,
who was not so clannish, used to laugh at her a little and
ask:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Why do you not take in all the human race at once,
since all are Sons and daughters of our first parents, and
brothers and sisters of ourselves?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he was right,” commented the old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But excuse me for interrupting you, uncle. You were
speaking of our kindred in this country, and we are anxious
to hear of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my boy, there are the Gordons, of Gordondell;
they are our third cousins, and live about seven miles south
of this on the Staunton road. They are a large family of
three generations, living in one house; but they are all
Gordons. Then there are the Bells, of the Elms; only two,
a bachelor brother and maiden sister, living on their little
place just beyond Wolfswalk. And the Clydes, my dears,
who live in the village, and keep a general store. There is
a young father and mother and half a dozen children. That
is all. They are all more or less injured by the war, and
are poor, and—some of them—somewhat embittered by
their losses; but they are our kindred, and we must have
them all here to meet you in the coming Christmas holidays.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“Tea is on the table, ma’am,” said Polly.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the party left the fireside and gathered around the
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sleigh ride had given them all fine appetites, and
they enjoyed their repast.</p>

<p class='c009'>After it was over, and the evening worship was offered
up, the little family separated and retired to rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so ended the first day at Wolfscliff; the first, also,
of many happy days.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cousins did not wait to be invited. The news of the
new arrival at the Hall was soon spread through the neighborhood
by the negroes, and neighbors and relatives lost no
time in calling on the young pair.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet these were not so truly calls as visits, for when
any one came to the house they arrived in the morning to
stay all day and take dinner and tea. They expected this,
and it was also expected of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The very first to come were the Gordons, who arrived
early in the morning a few days before Christmas. They
came in a big ox cart, and filled it. There was old Mr. and
Mrs. Gordon, an ancient couple nearly ninety years of age,
bowed, shriveled and white-haired, yet, withal, right merry;
and their bachelor brother and maiden sister, Mr. Tommy
and Miss Nancy Gordon, as aged and as merry as themselves;
then there was the son and daughter, Col. and Mrs.
George Gordon, both stout, rosy and full of the enjoyment
of this life, and their middle-aged bachelor brother and
maiden sister, Mr. Henry and Miss Rebecca Gordon. And
there were seven young men and three young women between
the ages of fifteen and twenty-seven. But, really, it
would take up too much time and space to tell you all their
names and ages and characters. They were a happy, rollicking
set of young people.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had not been much hurt either in mind, body or
estate by the war, and were neither depressed nor embittered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came the two old folks from the Elms. And, finally,
the Clydes, from the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>And besides these, neighbors came; old families who had
been in the land, as the Cleves had, from the first settlement
by the English—the Hills, the Ords, and the Balls—all
of whom lived within ten miles of Wolfscliff.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>And all of these kinsfolks and neighbors were warmly
welcomed at Wolfscliff, and well liked by Cleve and Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Christmas brought its usual festivities at the home, but
also a snowstorm that commenced on the morning of Christmas
Eve and continued all day and all night and all the
next day, covering the ground two feet deep, and toward
the close of the second day, when the wind rose, drifting in
places several yards deep.</p>

<p class='c009'>This made it impossible for the families at Wolfscliff to
leave the house; but Mr. Cleve held service in the large
drawing-room, where all his people from the plantation, as
well as the members of his household, were collected.</p>

<p class='c009'>And when the service was over Christmas gifts were distributed,
mostly in articles of clothing, to the servants. To
Palma he gave a casket of pearls and rubies that had been
his mother’s; to Stuart he gave a fine horse, with new saddle
and bridle, that he had within a few days past purchased
from a neighbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve and Palma gave to him an olive-green velveteen
dressing-grown and skullcap to match, which they had purchased
for this very purpose; and to the servants each they
gave a piece of gold coin, having nothing else to offer them.
And then the congregation dispersed joyfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>The snowstorm continued, with a high wind. The contemplated
dinner party for the twenty-seventh had to be
given up. The state of the road made travel impossible for
several days.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the first expeditions abroad was made by Josias,
who, mounted on a stout mule, tried to reach the post office
at Wolfswalk. It took him all day to go and come, but he
succeeded, and late in the evening brought back letters and
parcels that had been forwarded from New York to the
Stuarts—letters and parcels that bore the London and the
Haymore postmarks. The first were from the London solicitors
of the Hays, of Haymore, and contained the information
that certain railway, mining and manufacturing
shares had been transferred from the name of Randolph
Hay to that of Palma Hay Stuart, and were at her disposal,
and included the bonds—for, after all, self-indulgent Will
Walling had decided not to take the long journey to the
mountains of Virginia in the midst of winter, but to forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the documents by mail, and without even an explanatory
letter from himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you will have no trouble in finding the funds for
the reclamation of your Mississippi estate,” said John Cleve
with a smile as he received the information which Stuart
seemed proud and glad to give him. “Your wife’s cousin
is a noble, generous fellow. Whom did he marry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve Stuart was for a moment dumfounded by the question.
He had not so far risen above conventionality as not
to feel much embarrassment in replying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Judith Man, of California,” answered Palma, on
seeing that Stuart had found nothing to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! Who was she?” next inquired Mr. Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The best, the noblest, the loveliest girl I ever met with
in my life!” warmly responded Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! that is well, very well! Of what family was she?”
persevered the old gentleman, who was completely unconscious
of the embarrassment his questions were causing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really do not know, uncle, dear,” answered Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think we ever inquired,” replied Stuart, speaking
at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! well, it does not matter, so that she is a good, true
girl, worthy of the noble young fellow,” said Mr. Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is all that, uncle,” said Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma and Stuart then opened their letters. They were
from Ran and Judy, telling them of their arrival at Haymore,
their reception of Gentleman Geff and his “lady,”
and, indeed, of all the events that transpired in the first few
days of their stay at the Hall, and of which our readers
are already informed; making no mention of the transfer
of stocks from Ran to Palma; but renewing and pressing
their invitation that the Stuarts would visit them in England
during the next summer. Of course, Ran and Judy at
the time of writing their letter had not heard of Cleve and
Palma’s removal to West Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma was so little a worshiper of Mammon that she was
much more delighted with the faithful affection revealed in
these letters than with the accession of fortune that accompanied
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>She flew upstairs to answer them. She was earnest in her
thanks for Ran’s magnanimity in giving her so noble a
share in their grandfather’s fortune; but she was even more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>earnest in her appreciation of Judy’s friendship and their
mutual invitation to herself and Cleve. She had, however,
to explain why neither of them could take advantage of the
offered opportunity of visiting their friends in England, by
telling them of her own and her husband’s change of residence
and new-found happiness in the country home of
their aged uncle, and of the impossibility that they should
leave him while his presence on earth should be spared to
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve Stuart also answered Ran’s letters in very much
the same strain, giving the same thanks with much deprecation,
and offering the same explanations.</p>

<p class='c009'>These letters were all taken to the post office the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>In another week the weather moderated and the snow
melted. But traveling was, if possible, more difficult than
before, for the roads were sloughs of mud.</p>

<p class='c009'>But within doors, at Wolfscliff, all was pleasant, comfortable
and happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only Mrs. Pole complained of having too little to do.
But her special grievance did not last very long, for——</p>

<p class='c009'>On the morning of the fourteenth of February Palma
Stuart received from Above, in trust for earth and heaven,
a most precious valentine, in the form of a pair of twins,
a fine boy and girl. And no more grateful and delighted
mother dwelling on the “footstool” that day raised her
heart in prayer and thanksgiving to the Throne.</p>

<p class='c009'>No prouder father lived than Stuart, no happier uncle
than John Cleve, nor more important nurse than Mary
Pole. She had enough to do now, both day and night, to
nurse mother and babes.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the very first visit Stuart was allowed to make at the
bedside of his wife, when he had kissed her with deep feeling,
and had admired the twins to his heart’s content, she
said to him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cleve, dear, of course our boy must be named John
Cleve, after dear uncle and yourself. But our little girl?
Will you please ask uncle if he will let us call her Clarice,
after his own dear angel love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well thought of, darling. I know he will be pleased.
I will ask him as soon as I go downstairs,” warmly responded
Cleve Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“And you must go now, sir, if you please. She must be
quiet and go to sleep if she can,” said Mrs. Pole from the
eminence of her new authority.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart meekly bowed his head and obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The result of Palma’s proposal was this: Early in the afternoon,
when she had had a good sleep, had awakened and
taken refreshment, and was resting in peace and bliss, the
old gentleman came quietly into the room, sat down beside
her, and said softly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you, my dear. May the Lord bless you, and
may He bless your dear babes—little Clarice and John.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXII<br> <span class='large'>AN EARTHLY PARADISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Spring opens early on the southwestern section of Virginia,
and leaves, flowers and birds come soon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma and her babies were out with the violets and the
bluebirds. And no one could have more enjoyed the beautiful
weather in this glorious scene than the city-bred girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even in April, the cup-shaped vale, shut in by green-wooded
mountains, seemed a Garden of Eden, or the fairy
“Valley of Calm Delights.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart had taken to agricultural life as to his native element,
and often declared his delight in it, and expressed his
wonder how he, the descendant of a hundred generations of
farmers, could have been contented to live in a city.</p>

<p class='c009'>Directly after breakfast every morning he mounted his
horse and rode out afield to look after the laborers. Certainly,
much of the theory and practice of farming he had
to learn from his uncle; but he was an apt pupil. So apt,
he said to Palma, that his learning seemed to him more
like the recollection of forgotten knowledge than the acquisition
of new ideas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma, for her part, loved to put her two babies in the
double perambulator that had been brought from the nearest
town for their use, and, attended by Hatty, wheel them
out to the road that ran around the vale and was dotted with
the log huts and little gardens of the negroes on the side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>next to the mountain. This was like a royal progress.
Everywhere the young mother and children were greeted
with joy by the colored women and girls in the cabins.</p>

<p class='c009'>On week days none but women and children could be
found there; all the men were afield.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Sunday they would all, or nearly all, go to church;
and it was a strange thing that a little community, numbering
less than one hundred, men, women and children all
counted, should include so many religious sects; for here
were to be found Catholics, Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
Methodists and Baptists. I think that was all; for of finer
sub-divisions of doctrine or opinion they knew nothing, and
a more Christian community than the people of this plantation,
notwithstanding their sectarian differences, could scarcely
be found anywhere. And this was owing, in a great
measure, to the teachings and example of their master—a
pure Christian.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was accustomed to say to them:</p>

<p class='c009'>“By whatever sectarian name you choose to call yourselves
matters little; be Christian. ‘The disciples were called
Christians first at Antioch.’ ‘For there is no other name
under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
but that of Christ.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Old ’Sias being asked one day by a stranger as to his
religious faith and experience answered that he was Christian,
and his law of life was love of God and his neighbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The people loved their master well. Not one left him
when emancipation was proclaimed. Even the young men,
who longed to see life, would not leave old master while he
should live on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Cleve was the friend, teacher and patriarch of his
people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never in his life, however, had the old man been so
happy as at present. The society of Stuart, Palma and their
babies opened new springs of joy in his heart and home.
He loved to spend hours reclining in his easy-chair on the
piazza, with the young mother seated near him and the
infants in their pretty basket cradle beside her, while Mrs.
Pole would be looking after household affairs within, and
Stuart would be supervising agricultural matters afield.</p>

<p class='c009'>The twins were little more than two months old when
John Cleve saw, or thought he saw, a growing likeness between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the tiny Clarice and the angel for whom she was
named. As for him, he was waiting the call to come and
rejoin his own Clarice in one of the many mansions of our
Father’s house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor was the summons long delayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a lovely morning in May.</p>

<p class='c009'>The vale was more like than ever to a Garden of Eden.
It was a chalice full of bloom, fragrance and music lifted
up in offering to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart was absent on horseback, riding from field to field,
overlooking the workmen.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the other members of the family were gathered on the
front porch.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole, with a pair of shears in her hands, was walking
about the place, carefully clipping a few dead leaves from
the rose vines that climbed about the pillars. She had taken
to gardening with as much enthusiasm as Stuart had taken
to farming.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma sat on a little, low chair, busy with her needlework.
At her feet stood the pretty basket cradle in which
lay the twin babes, sleeping.</p>

<p class='c009'>Near them sat John Cleve, reclining in a large resting-chair.
His hands were folded before him, and he was
gazing out upon the scene with a face illumined by reverence
and serene rapture. Not a word had he spoken since
the babies went to sleep. Now he murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! the beauty and the glory of Thy sunlit earth and
heavens, our Father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The words seemed to issue involuntarily from the lips of
the speaker in the midst of the deep silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! the loveliness of Thy celestial angels!” he murmured
in a lower and a slower tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma looked up from her sewing.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not speak again.</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned around to look at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had sunk back in his chair and shrunken together.
His hands lay folded on his knees, his head bowed on his
chest, and his silver hair shining in the morning sunlight.
His face could not possibly be whiter than it had always
been since she had known him, but something else in his
aspect startled and alarmed her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>She sprang up and went to him, bent over him, and laid
her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle! Uncle!” she said softly but eagerly, anxiously—“Uncle!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t distress—yourself, dear—it is all right—bless
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These were his last words. His whole slight frame seemed
to collapse and shrink closer together, his head sank lower,
his hands slipped apart and dropped down by his sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mrs. Pole, startled by some sound, hurried to the
spot, she found Palma in a panic of grief and amazement
too deep for utterance, standing over the lifeless body of
the good old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole in great emergencies had but little self-possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>She threw up her hands in horror, and then ran wildly
in and out of the house, shrieking:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Polly! Hatty! ’Sias!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And as the frightened servants came running at her call,
the women from the kitchen, the man from the lawn, they
found the young mistress down on the floor at the feet of
the dead master, with her hands clasped around his knees
and her head bowed upon them, sobbing as if her heart
must break. Tears had come and broken the trance of
sorrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run for the doctor! Run for Mr. Stuart! Run all of
you!” cried Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the servants ran in all directions to spread the news
or to bring efficient help.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole went to Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get up, my dear child! Let me help you up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t—don’t,” gasped Palma in a smothered tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come with me,” persisted the woman, taking hold
of her arm and trying to lift her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave me! Leave me!” cried the mourner, clinging the
closer to her dead, and continuing obdurate to all entreaty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve Stuart, found and summoned by ’Sias, soon came
galloping up to the house, threw himself off his horse and
hurried up on the porch.</p>

<p class='c009'>One look of awe, sorrow and reverence to the changed
face of his uncle showed him what had happened. Then he
looked on his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“Make her get up, sir. Do make her get up. I can’t
get her to move from that!” sobbed Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did this happen?” inquired Stuart in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not twenty minutes ago, I reckon, though I’m not sure.
It was as quick as lightning. One moment he was talking
bright and cheerful, and the next moment he was gone like
a flash! Oh! make her get up, sir. She will kill herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Palma, dear, you must let me take you in,” he said, laying
his hand gently on the bowed head of his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>But sobs were her only reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Palma, we will have to take him in and lay him on his
bed. Come with me first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But she only wept and sobbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>With gentle force he took her arms from around the dead,
lifted her, bore her into the parlor, laid her on the sofa and
called Polly to attend her.</p>

<p class='c009'>He returned to the porch, told Mrs. Pole to look after the
babies and leave everything else to him, and called the grief-stricken
’Sias to help him to carry the dead into the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a very light weight for so tall and broad-shouldered
a man, but, then, it was but little more than skin and
bone, a human chrysalis.</p>

<p class='c009'>They bore it to the chamber in the rear of the parlor on
the ground floor, that had been John Cleve’s sleeping-room.
Here they laid it on the bed to await the arrival of the
family physician. The latter could do no good, but all the
same he must come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not until afternoon could the busy country doctor, whose
practice extended over many miles, be found and brought to
Wolfscliff.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was conducted by Stuart to the room of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A death from old age, pure and simple,” was the verdict
of science.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever see a body more thoroughly consumed by
the life of the spirit? I have known Mr. Cleve all my life,
as my father and my grandfather knew him before me, and
I never knew of, or heard of, his having a day’s illness,”
concluded Dr. Osborne as they sat together beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was a saint prepared for heaven,” reverently replied
the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they arose, and standing on each side of the bed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>drew the sheet up over the calm, cold face and left the room
together.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor went away, kindly offering to transact any
business that was now required for the family and for the
deceased at Wolfswalk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart went to inquire about the condition of his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly had put her to bed, and Mrs. Pole had laid her
sleeping infants in with her, the one on her right side and
the other on her left. They were the best sedatives, for the
tender mother was obliged to control herself for fear of
disturbing them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole, now as quiet and decorous as in the morning
she had been noisy and turbulent, sat in a large easy-chair,
watching the three.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Stuart softly opened the door she raised her finger
in warning, and then silently arose and went to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She has just fallen asleep herself. I wouldn’t speak to
her now, if I was you. She is sleeping very quiet,” she
said in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank Heaven! Take care of her, Mrs. Pole,” murmured
Cleve in a low tone as he withdrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole closed the door and went back to resume her
watch.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three days later the mortal body of John Cleve, of Wolfscliff,
was borne to the family burial ground on the plateau
on one of the hills that looked up to the sky. It was followed
by a great concourse of people, consisting of kindred,
friends, servants and neighbors from far and near.</p>

<p class='c009'>The services were concluded there, with these few words
of such divine love and truth that I quote them here for the
comfort they may give to all sorrowing souls who grieve
because they think, and think wrongly, that they have laid
their loved ones in the grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘And now, having performed the last service of love to
our dear brother by laying his body in the earth from which
it came, we leave it there, as he has left it, to follow him
by faith to his eternal home.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Will my readers note the use of the pronouns there?
There is deep meaning in that.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the obsequies, life went on very calmly at Wolfscliff.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Stuart and Palma wrote every week to their friends in
England, and quite as often got letters from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Ran and Judy urged Stuart and Palma to come
and visit them, as there was nothing now to keep the latter
at Wolfscliff. They wrote that they had given up their plan
of leaving Haymore Hall to study in London. That the
attractions of the country and the home were so great that
they could not tear themselves away from it. That they
had formed attachments not only to the place, but to the
people. That they should remain there, and that the Rev.
James Campbell had undertaken to direct their studies, and
they expected to derive quite as much—if not more—benefit
from his instructions as they could from professional
teachers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The correspondence resulted in a promise from the
Stuarts to run over to England after the wheat harvest
should be gathered.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was while Stuart was thinking of setting a certain day
for their embarkation and purchasing their tickets that a
strange visitor arrived at Wolfscliff.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a glorious day in the latter part of June.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart was afield, looking after the wheat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma was seated on the front piazza, with her babies
placed face to face in their cradle on her right hand, and
her workbasket, overflowing with work, on her left.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was singing to herself in a low key when she heard
the sound of wheels on the gravel walk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking up, she saw the hack from the Wolfshead tavern,
at Wolfswalk, approaching. It drew up before the porch.</p>

<p class='c009'>The coachman got off his box and went to the carriage
door and opened it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A gentleman got out—a tall, thin man of about forty
years of age, with dark, reddish-brown hair and beard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma laid aside her work and stood up to receive the
visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>He came up the steps of the piazza, stopped, raised his
hat, and as he looked at the childlike young matron before
him, said with some hesitation:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs.—Stuart? Have I the honor of speaking to Mrs.
Stuart?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is my name, sir,” replied Palma politely.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>He bowed and handed her a card, on which she read:
“The O’Melaghlin, Carrick Arghalee, Antrim, Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you come into the house, sir? Mr. Stuart is not
here at present, but he is not far off, and I will send for
him at once,” said Palma, leading the way into the hall
and touching a call-bell as she passed a stand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, madam,” said the stranger, following her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She conducted him into the drawing-room, gave him a
seat and turned to speak to Hatty, who had come in answer
to the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ask Mrs. Pole, please, to go to the children on the
piazza. Then send ’Sias to look for Mr. Stuart, to tell him
that there is a gentleman here waiting to see him, and give
him this card,” said Palma, putting the slip of pasteboard
into the girl’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is ’Sias for to gib dis to young marster?” inquired
Hatty, dubiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, certainly. Go away now and do your errands. Go
to Mrs. Pole first,” said the anxious young mother. And
then she sat down near the front window, through which,
from time to time, she could glance out and see that no
harm should come to the babies until the arrival of her relief
sentinel, Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma was not very well versed in the ways of the world,
yet she felt it incumbent on her to entertain the stranger,
but she did not exactly know how to do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are recently from Ireland. I have some very dear
friends of that country. Indeed, my nearest kinsman married
a young girl of that nation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I am aware of that fact. Mr. Randolph Hay married
Miss Judith Man—that brings me here to-day. But
as for myself, I have not seen Ireland for twenty-one years,”
said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma looked up in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been in California, Colorado, Australia, Tasmania,
Cape Colony—everywhere else but in my native
land,” continued the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I came last from California,” concluded the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma suddenly remembered that it was rude to stare in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>silence at any one, especially at a visitor in one’s own house;
so she dropped her eyes and said demurely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad you knew Judith Man, Mrs. Randolph Hay,
of Haymore, my cousin by marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know her at all. All the same, she is my daughter—my
only daughter—and I hope to find her soon, with
your assistance, and to make her acquaintance. It is for
that purpose that I am here,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Palma stared in right good earnest, without once
thinking whether she was rude or not. Moreover, she committed
another breach of good manners—she echoed his
words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your daughter!” she exclaimed in astonishment and incredulity.
“I never did hear of such a thing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps not,” said the visitor, laughing good-humoredly;
“but it is true, nevertheless. And, besides, there
are a great many million</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘More things in heaven and earth’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>than you ever did hear of, or ever will hear of, my dear
young lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon, sir; but indeed I was so taken by surprise!”
said Palma, apologetically, and with a pretty blush.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all!” exclaimed the stranger, rather irrelevantly.
“Say no more about it; but tell me something of my son
and my daughter. You said nothing about my son, yet I
have been told that they are both equally and intimately
well known to you and to your excellent husband. What
are these young people like, madam, if you please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mike and Judy? They are both lovely! Just lovely!”
warmly responded Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is exceedingly complimentary, and would be highly
satisfactory, only it is not quite exact enough. A rose is
lovely, so is a pearl, so is a fawn, so is a baby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed the young mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So many things are lovely, you see, that to say they are
lovely gives me no clear idea of them. Be more precise,
dear lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, then, they are so good, so sweet—but I think I had
better show you their photographs,” said Palma, with sudden
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“The very thing!” exclaimed the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma sprang up and ran like an eager child to the other
end of the drawing-room and to an <em>etagere</em> that stood in
the corner, and took from it a large-paged but thin photograph
album, with which she returned to her visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This book,” she said, “contains only the pictures of our
dearest friends. There are not more than thirty-three pictures
in the collection; but then there are in some cases
several of each person. I will show you Mike’s and Judy’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” exclaimed the visitor. “Pray let me have the
book and see if I can find them for myself. I have never
seen them. You are naturally amazed to hear me say that,
but you shall know the reason of the fact in good time,”
said The O’Melaghlin, as he received the book from Palma,
who, having placed it in his hands, resumed her seat,
watched him as he turned over the leaves, and speculated
with much interest whether he would be able to identify the
pictures of his son and daughter, whom he had never seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently his face lighted up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here they are!” he exclaimed, pointing to the open
pages that presented full-length cabinet photographs of
Mike and Judy—the former being on the left-hand page
and the latter on the right.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you are right,” replied Palma in surprise; “but
how could you tell?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because this,” he replied, laying his finger on Judy’s
picture, “is a perfect likeness of my dear lost Moira; and
this,” he added, indicating Mike’s, “is as like her as a youth
can be like his mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are faithful likenesses of the twin brother and
sister,” replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now tell me, my dear young lady, about my boy and
girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your daughter, I have said, is sweet and good and very
dear to us all who know her. To say that she is married
to one of the wealthiest land owners of one of the oldest
families in Yorkshire would be true, but it would not be
so much as to say that her husband is one of the best, the
truest, the most generous and most magnanimous of men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your praise is enthusiastic, therefore extravagant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It could not be. Ask Judy herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ask a young woman still in love! She would be a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>impartial witness, no doubt,” laughed The O’Melaghlin.
“But now about my boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is altogether worthy of his sister and his brother-in-law.
I could not say any more for him than that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which is to say that he is good, true and brave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he is all that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But his objects in life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be of the best use to any whom he may serve; and
the better to do this, he wishes to get a good education.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right! And he is young enough still to go to
college, not being quite twenty years of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am so glad for his sake that you have come forward;
because Michael has that spirit of independence that
he shrinks from being indebted to his good brother-in-law
for his college fees.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right is that also. He is a true O’Melaghlin, and
I am proud of him! And now, my dear young lady, you
may be wondering how I discovered yourself and your husband
and your connection—happy connection for them—with
my children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has been equally happy for us, sir, indeed. Michael
and Judith are among our most esteemed friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear you say so, dear madam.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br> <span class='large'>THE KINGLY O’MELAGHLINS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At this moment Cleve Stuart so quietly entered the room
that Palma was not aware of his entrance until he stood
before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. O’Melaghlin—Mr. Stuart,” she said, presenting the
gentlemen to each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>The visitor arose and both bowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bring a letter of introduction for you, sir, from the
Messrs. Walling, of New York,” said The O’Melaghlin,
drawing from his breast a neat, open envelope and handing
it to Mr. Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve took it with a bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the envelope, besides the superscription—“To Cleve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Stuart, Esq., Wolfscliff, W. V.,”—there was written between
brackets, in the corner: “To introduce The O’Melaghlin,
Carrick Arghalee, Antrim.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, the use of the definite article as the prefix of a
man’s surname had been a puzzle to Palma, and even a surprise
to Cleve, though he remembered that in the north of
Ireland, as well as in Scotland, it was affected by certain
heads of families among the landed gentry of ancient lineage,
and considered to outrank either plain “Mr.” or
“Squire.” O’Melaghlin, therefore, must be recognized as
The O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With your permission,” said Stuart, with a bow, as he
opened the letter, which was as follows—and rather more
than sarcastic in its peculiar style, as Cleve thought when
he read it, though he hoped and believed that the bearer
of the letter had not—if he had read the words—perceived
the sarcasm:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Office of Walling &#38; Walling</span>, Att’ys, Etc.</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“New York, May 8, 187—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Cleve Stuart, Esq.</span>, Wolfscliff, W. V.: I have the great
honor to present—you—to The O’Melaghlin, of Carrick Arghalee,
Antrim, Ireland.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The O’Melaghlin is of the most ancient Irish, royal
lineage, being directly descended from the O’Melaghlins,
monarchs of Meath, whose kingdom was ravaged by Henry
the Second, A. D. 1173, and given to one of his thievish
followers, a disreputable carpet-bagger, called Hugh de
Lacy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The O’Melaghlin hails now from Antrim because his
ancestor, Patricious O’Melaghlin, in the reign of Edward
the First, 1285, married Mona, sole child and heiress of
Fergus of Arghalee, and subsequently became lord of Carrick
Arghalee, in right of his wife. From this illustrious
pair, representing a royal and a noble family united, The
O’Melaghlin is directly descended.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It would be highly impertinent in so humble an individual
as myself to write of this gentleman’s merits and accomplishments.
Should he honor you with his acquaintance,
you will discover them for yourself. You will also hear
from him in what manner you can have the distinction of
serving him.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“With compliments and congratulations to yourself and

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>William Walling</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Will Walling is a scamp, and merits a kicking for his
impudence,” was Stuart’s half-earnest, half-jesting mental
criticism on this letter and its writer. He thought he knew
the reason for Will Walling’s sneers; he thought it was more
than likely that The O’Melaghlin had repelled the genial
Will and “kept him at a distance.” He folded the letter,
put it in his pocket, and once more offered his hand to the
visitor, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very happy to see you here, sir, and shall be very
much pleased if I can serve you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you, Wolfscliff!” exclaimed The O’Melaghlin,
giving his host his territorial title as if they had been in Antrim.
“I thank you, sir. You have given me the hand of
a friend, and although you may not at this moment recall
the fact, you have given me the hand of a kinsman! Yes,
sir, I am proud to say of a kinsman!” and he gave that
hand a grip that crippled it for a week.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A kinsman, O’Melaghlin!” exclaimed Cleve—he would
have given great offense if he had addressed his guest as
Mr. O’Melaghlin—“I am very much flattered, but I do not
understand!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, then, Wolfscliff, is not your family name Stuart?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And have you not a lawful right to that name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you not spell it S-t-u-a-r-t?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you are my kinsman on the distaff side! Yes,
there is but one root of the tree of Stuart, and that is the
old royal root that grew fast in Scottish ground, and every
one who lawfully bears the name of Stuart is a leaf of that
same tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Granted,” said Cleve, with perhaps a faint leaven of sinful
pride, “granted that my ancestor seven generations back
was Charles Stuart, called the Young Pretender, how should
that make us kinsmen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid, young Wolfscliff, that you do not keep yourself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>well posted up in your family genealogy,” said The
O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I do not,” replied Stuart, with a laugh. “I fear
I know little or nothing with certainty of my family on
either side the house previous to their emigration to America.
Why, O’Melaghlin, do you know if I could become a
candidate for the highest office in this country, and knew
who was my grandfather, it would be a grave objection to
me in the minds of this democratic and republican people—unless,
indeed, I could prove that he was a tramp, a
gypsy, or, at the very best, a day laborer!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The O’Melaghlin stroked his long, rusty red beard and
slowly shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The human race is going to ruin,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But will you kindly explain how it is that we are of kin,
sir?” said Palma hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely, my dear young lady—surely. The facts are
these: From prehistoric ages, in the dark before the dawn
of time or of its record, to which the memory of mankind
goeth not back. The O’Melaghlins were monarchs of
Munster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And lived in caves, and dressed in skins, and when a
young king wanted a wife he walked into the next kingdom
with his club on his shoulders, knocked down the first young
girl he saw and brought her away on his back. Was it not
so?” archly suggested Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Faith! I think you are right, ma’am. Since the
O’Melaghlins go back to the darkest of days, they must
have had the manners of the same,” said the chieftain, good-humoredly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, please go on. I will try not to interrupt you
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The O’Melaghlins were monarchs of Meath for unnumbered
generations before the Christian era, and for eleven
centuries and a half after. Somewhere about the year 1160
Henry the Second—bad luck to the beast!—made the conquest
of Ireland, ravaged the kingdom of Meath, and gave
the land to a thieving carpet-bagger of his own, Hugh de
Lacy by name. Ah! but The O’Melaghlins, turned out of
their own, made short work of the usurper and murdered
him in his stolen castle of Thrim. It was of no avail. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>successors came after him, backed up by the power of the
Saxon. The O’Melaghlins were scattered far and wide.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of the tragedies of history,” said Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“True for you, O’Wolfscliff! The next memorable apoch
in the history of that r’yal family fell in the reign of
Edward the First, in the year 1270, more than a century
after the conquest of Meath. Then the young head of the
family—The O’Melaghlin of that apoch—married the Lady
Mona, sole child and heiress of Fergus of Arghalee, surnamed
the Tiger, and in due time, in right of his wife, succeeded
to the chieftainship and became The O’Melaghlin of
Carrick Arghalee! That, sir and madam, was the first step
taken toward a union with the r’yal house of Scotland, from
which you, sir, descinded.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(The chieftain, when interested or excited, sometimes
slipped into dialect.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed!” exclaimed Stuart, rather mystified, for he did
not as yet see the road to the royal alliance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now then,” continued The O’Melaghlin, “that marriage
was the first step, as I said. Nearly two centuries passed
before the second step was taken. But then, centuries don’t
count for much with old historic families whose origin is
only lost in the ancient, prehistoric ages. It was in the year
1380, in the reign of Robert the Second, King of Scotland,
that Randolph of Arghalee married the Lady Grauch,
daughter of the Earl of Fife, who was the second son of the
reigning monarch. D’ye moind, that’s where the r’yal blood
comes in, and our kinship, more betoken! So shake hands
upon it, Wolfscliff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart good-humoredly put out his hand, already half
crippled by O’Melaghlin’s first clasp, and received a second
crushing grip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now will you kindly inform me how I can be of
service to you?” inquired the host.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir, certainly. I wish to find my children,
Michael and Judith. I was told by Mr. Walling that you
would be able to give me their exact address, which he said
was in London somewhere, but he could not tell where.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While The O’Melaghlin spoke Stuart stared and Palma
laughed. She felt a child’s delight at his astonishment in
discovering that The O’Melaghlin was the father of Michael
Man and Judith Hay.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“Oh!” said the visitor, “you are surprised, sure, to hear
me say this, but they are my children, for all that I have
never set eyes on them in my life. It was not my fault,
but the fate made by circumstances, that kept us apart. It
is a painful story, sir, that I may tell you later at your convenience.
Now I wish to ask you where, in all the great
wilderness of London, I may find my children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nowhere in London. They are not there. They have
changed their plans, and will remain for some time to come
at Haymore Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely I thought they were going to London for private
tuition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They can obtain that better, perhaps, at Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps, O’Melaghlin, you would like to see your daughter’s
last letter to my wife,” kindly suggested Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, that I would, if Mrs. Stuart has no objections, and
it is very kind of you to offer to show it to me, and I thank
you, Wolfscliff,” heartily responded the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>And before he had finished speaking Palma had darted
away in search of her letter box. She soon returned with
it, sat down, placed it on her lap, opened it and took out
a bundle of letters, from which she selected one to hand it to
the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>He quickly snatched it, and with an almost greedy look,
so eager was the father to read the words of his unknown
daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>He “devoured” the contents of that letter, though none
of its words could speak of him, who was equally unknown
to his daughter, and although they only told of household
and neighborhood news, and of their changed plans in regard
to the scene of their studies and the person of their
tutor.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had dwelt on the letter as long as possible he
returned it to its owner with manifest reluctance and cast
covetous glances at the pile of letters from which it had
been drawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you like to read all your daughter’s letters?
You can, of course, if you wish it, sir,” said Palma kindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, madam, if you would be so good as to let me do
so,” gratefully replied the father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here they are, then, about twenty of them in all, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>they are long letters. Take them and read them at your
leisure. Now there is the dinner bell. You will join us, I
hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, my dear madam; but I am just off a long
journey, and hardly presentable in a sitting-room, much less
at a dinner table,” said The O’Melaghlin, glancing down
at his dusty garments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, never mind. We are plain country people,” said
Palma, with a smile; for having lived in a crowded city all
her life, with the exception of one short season at “Lull’s,”
she took pride in thinking of herself as a country woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you would like to go to a room to brush off a little,
I should be pleased to show you the way,” said Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Wolfscliff, I think I would if it will not
delay your dinner or spoil your soup. Now speak frankly.
There should be candor among kinsmen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will spoil nothing,” put in Palma, knowing that
Cleve could not answer that question, “so, Mr. Stuart,
please show The O’Melaghlin to the oak room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve turned with a bow to his guest and led the way
out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma rang the bell and gave orders that the soup should
be kept back for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>In due time The O’Melaghlin reappeared in the drawing-room,
and the small party went in to dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of that meal Stuart said to Palma:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, The O’Melaghlin has kindly promised to remain
with us a few days, and has sent back his chaise to the
Wolfshead to fetch his baggage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very much pleased to hear this,” said Palma, turning
with a bright smile to the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, madam! You may wonder, perhaps, why
I should have chosen to travel all the way down from New
York to West Virginia to get from you the London address
of my children, when I might have written to you and got
it by return mail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; indeed, I never once thought of it in that manner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I may as well tell you how it was. When I learned
from Mr. Walling that my children were in London, I determined
to go there as soon as possible. And knowing what
a rush there is across the big pond at this season of the year,
I went to get my passage secured in the first available
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>steamer. But, bless you! though I went to every office of
ocean steamers in New York, and wrote to every one in
Boston, I could get no sort of a passage in any one for the
next six weeks. The first one I could engage was for the
first of July, in the steamer <em>Leviathan</em> for Southampton.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why! Are you going by the <em>Leviathan</em>? We are going
by that ship!” impulsively exclaimed Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are!” cried The O’Melaghlin, appealing to Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed we are!” responded the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Delight upon delight! That is almost too good to be
true! Well, I am overjoyed to hear this! Now to resume
my explanation why I came to you instead of writing:
Finding that I had three weeks upon my hands I said to
myself: ‘I will not write to get meager news. I will go
down to West Virginia and see these near connections of my
unknown children, and I will talk with them and get from
them every detail of my son’s and daughter’s lives and characters.’
And so here I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now that you are here, O’Melaghlin, we hope that
you will stay with us until the day comes when we must
all leave Wolfscliff for New York to embark on our voyage,”
said Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>The visitor turned and looked inquiringly on the lady’s
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, do, Mr. O’Melaghlin. We should be so happy
to have you!” she exclaimed, in response to that mute appeal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do me much honor, sir and madam. And to be
frank with you, there is nothing on my part to prevent
my acceptance and enjoyment of your kindness and hospitality,”
replied The O’Melaghlin in modest words, but with
a pompous manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma then withdrew and left the two men over their
claret, and went to put her babies to bed. When this sweet
duty was done she returned to the drawing-room, where she
was soon joined by Stuart and O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>And there, later in the evening, the latter told his story.
It was the common story of a race of men and a fine estate
falling into decadence from generation to generation. This
The O’Melaghlin, in telling the tale, attributed to the misfortunes
of the family, and the persecutions of the Saxon.
But to those who could read between the lines, even of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>version, it was self-evident that the downfall of the house
was due to the vice and folly of its representatives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Few men in the position of The O’Melaghlin would tell
such a story with perfect frankness. Certainly he did not
so tell his. And therefore it seems necessary, in the interests
of truth, that it should be told by me.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the exception of those absurd traditions of the prehistoric
period of which no one can know anything, the
proud family record of The O’Melaghlins, previous to their
degradation, was in the main true, as every student of Irish
history knows. But for a century past The O’Melaghlins
of Arghalee had been fast livers, hard drinkers and reckless
sinners. In every generation, every succeeding heir had
come into his patrimony poorer in purse, prouder in spirit,
and weaker in will to resist evil than any of his predecessors.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length, about twenty-five years before the period of
which I write, young Michael O’Melaghlin, at the age of
twenty-one, came into the remnant of the grand old estate,
consisting then of the half-ruined castle of Arghalee and
a few acres of sterile land immediately around it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was the last of his family, and would have been alone
in the world but that he loved and was beloved by a good
and beautiful girl, well born, like himself; an orphan, like
himself; poor, like himself, and even poorer, since she had
not so much as a ruinous house and an acre of ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moira MacDuinheld lived with distant relatives in the
neighborhood of Arghalee.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were not kind to her; they grudged her the cost of
her maintenance; and when young Michael O’Melaghlin
came courting her, they encouraged his suit that they might
get rid of their burden; and they let him marry her, although
they knew they were delivering her to poverty and
privation, if to nothing worse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Michael then married Moira with the full consent of her
kindred, and took her home to his dilapidated, rat-infested,
raven-haunted, storm-beaten old donjon keep, which was all
that was left of the castle of Arghalee.</p>

<p class='c009'>But soon the young pair began to suffer the bitterest
pangs of poverty. We cannot go into detail here. Let it
be sufficient to say that often they had not enough to eat,
even of the plainest food. But, although “poverty had come
in at the door, love did not fly out of the window,” for they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>loved each other more faithfully, because more pitifully,
for all their privations and sufferings. And here comes in
the insanity of pride. Both Michael and Moira were strong,
healthy, able-bodied young people, and could each have obtained
work in the neighborhood; Michael as a farm laborer,
if nothing more—and he could have done little more, for
he had but very little education, and Moira might have become
a laundress—a trade easily acquired. But for an
O’Melaghlin—a descendant of the ancient monarchs of
Meath—to work! No! In the narrow, one-idea mind of
the impoverished chieftain it was more noble to starve and
to see his young wife starve, or to accept alms, and deem the
bestower to be highly honored in being permitted to
minister to the needs of The O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>But hunger is a mighty factor in the affairs of life. It
is said to have civilized the world. At least it exercised
a very powerful influence upon these two healthy young
people, who were almost always hungry, seldom having
enough of oatmeal or potatoes on any day to satisfy their
robust appetites. And when they had suffered this hunger
for several months, and saw nothing but hunger in all the
future, The O’Melaghlin suddenly resolved to sell all the
remainder of his land, except one acre upon which his
ruined tower stood—the oldest, as it was also the only part
of the great castle now in existence—and with the money
he might get for them go with his young wife to the gold
fields of California. There, in the far-off foreign land,
where he would not be known, he would seek for the gold
that should restore the fortunes of his family. Upon whomsoever
the gold fever fastens it fills with a furore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gold was The O’Melaghlin’s thought by day and his
dream by night. Gold seeking, he persuaded himself, was
not work—or at least it was not work for hire; and, besides,
he would be a stranger in a strange land; and no one at
home here in Antrim should ever be able to say that The
O’Melaghlin had ever soiled his hands or blotted his
‘scutcheon with labor!</p>

<p class='c009'>He sold four acres of his land for little more than enough
money to take himself and his wife, by way of Glasgow,
to San Francisco. He was offered nearly twice as much
money if he would sell the remaining acre with the ancient
tower upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>But at the proposal The O’Melaghlin grew furious and
insolent.</p>

<p class='c009'>What! Sell the very donjon keep, the last stronghold of
The O’Melaghlins of Arghalee? Many a time had the
Saxons besieged the castle, and sometimes they had taken
the outworks, but never the donjon keep. And now he
would see their island scuttled in the midst and sunk between
its four seas, like the rotten old craft that it was, before
he would sell his tower and the last acre of ground on
which it stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though why this jeremiad should have been uttered
against “the Saxon,” when it was an Irishman and a near
relative who wanted to buy his old owl roost, no one but
The O’Melaghlin himself could have explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>His dream was to realize a fabulous fortune from the
gold fields and come back and restore the tower, rebuild the
castle and repurchase all the land sold by his forefathers
for generations past. To do all this would require a vast
fortune; but would he not make that fortune?</p>

<p class='c009'>Heaven and earth! Did not many a common bit of
human clay without family or name of the least value make
a large fortune in the gold fields? When, then, The O’Melaghlin
stooped to seek the ore, would not the earth open
wide her bosom of uncounted treasures and lavish gold upon
him?</p>

<p class='c009'>The O’Melaghlin never doubted for an instant that she
would.</p>

<p class='c009'>So in due time The O’Melaghlin and his wife sailed from
Glasgow, bound for San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went in the first cabin of the <em>Golden Glory</em>. Do
you think The O’Melaghlin would take second place in any
circumstances? No, he would die first!</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached San Francisco he took a room for
himself and wife at one of the very best hotels, which was
also, of course, one of the most expensive in the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave his name to the office clerk as:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The O’Melaghlin,” which that hurried and distracted
individual incontinently put down as:</p>

<p class='c009'>T. O. Mannikin.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIV<br> <span class='large'>PARENTAGE OF MIKE AND JUDY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The young pair had been in the city only a few days
when, after diligent inquiries in all possible directions,
O’Melaghlin heard a rumor of a rich new field of gold in the
Black Rock Ridges, some fifty miles from the city, and of
a party of adventurers about forming to start for that point.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Melaghlin determined to join that expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>His young wife, Moira, was much too delicate just at this
time to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He left her at the hotel with nearly all the little money
he had to bear her expenses during his absence, which he
promised should be as short as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said he would come back to see her about the time
she might be able to return with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he went away, and Moira remained at the hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed a cruel act so to leave a young wife, who was
expecting within four or five weeks to become a mother;
but The O’Melaghlin had the gold fever in its most malignant
form, and had even infected her with the fell disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>She also had feverish and delirious hallucinations concerning
the imaginary golden days that were dawning upon
them, of which, indeed, her present elegant and luxurious
surroundings in this palace hotel seemed a prophecy and a
foretaste. Never in her life had Moira seen, dreamed or
imagined such magnificence as this public house presented
to her. And to make such a superb style of living their
own for life was worth some present sacrifice of each other’s
society for a little while. So she willingly let her husband
depart with the gold-seekers, and whenever she felt very
lonesome without him she just shut her eyes and called up
the inward vision of the gorgeous future.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet there were moods in which she grew too deeply impressed
to look beyond the immediate, impending trial,
bringing certain pain and danger and possible death before
giving her, if it should ever give her, the crown of a woman’s
life—maternity.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had made some few pleasant acquaintances among
the ladies who were boarding at the hotel, and who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>charmed by the artless and confiding manners of this beautiful
wild Irish girl—or child-woman. And when they discovered
her fears they laughed her into courage again,
telling her that such dark forebodings as hers were quite
an indispensable part of the program, and every mother
among them all had been through it. And they spoke the
truth, as every doctor knows.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this hotel was a house patronized by travelers and
transient boarders only.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ladies who had made Moira’s acquaintance and become
her friends one after another went their way, and she
was left alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>True, others came. Every day they came and went.
Some stayed a few hours; some stayed a few days. Among
these were women who would have been very kind to the
lonely young stranger if they had had the chance. But
they had not. They never saw her, or saw to notice her.</p>

<p class='c009'>With her increasing infirmities, the young wife, when
daily expecting to become a mother, grew very shy and
timid. She seldom went down into the ladies’ parlor—that
neutral ground upon which acquaintances are sometimes
made, and even friendships occasionally formed; and when
she did go for a little change, she would conceal herself
between the curtain and sash of some front window, and so,
hidden from the company, look out upon the brilliant life
of Sacramento Street until the utter weariness that now
so frequently overcame her strength compelled her to creep
away to the repose of her own private apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toward the last of her life she gave up entirely going
to the ladies’ parlor, and confined her walk to the stairs
and halls between her bedchamber and the public dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>This walk was her only exercise, her only change of scene,
and she continued it daily to the last day of her life.</p>

<p class='c009'>She made no new acquaintances in place of those who
had gone away. She had no friend except an humble one
in the chambermaid who attended to her room. In many
respects she was worse off in this elegant and luxurious
house than she would have been in the rudest log cabin of
a mining camp, for here, though she had everything else,
she lacked what she would have got there—human companionship
and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Often she longed—wildly longed—to see or hear from her
husband, but knew that it was impossible for her to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet she had one great stay and comfort—her Christian
faith. She was devoutly religious and spent much time in
her room in reading the Bible, or some book of devotion,
or in prayer, or in singing in a low tone some favorite hymn.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the time passed until about six weeks after The
O’Melaghlin had gone away to seek his fortune, when there
came a change. She fell too ill to go down to dinner that
evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The friendly chambermaid, who volunteered to bring her
a cup of tea, also offered to spend the night with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moira gratefully accepted these services.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before midnight the girl had to call the night watchman
and get him to send a messenger out for the nearest physician,
who came promptly in answer to the call.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moira saw the sun rise once more for the last time. Then
she died, leaving behind her a pair of healthy twins—a boy
and a girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her death was so sudden, so unexpected, that it seemed as
if a bright, strong torch had been instantly inverted and
extinguished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then there was a commotion and a sensation in the hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where was the husband of the dead woman, the father of
the motherless babes?</p>

<p class='c009'>The office book was searched to see who was the party
who had taken Room 777 seven weeks previous, and the
register showed the name of T. O. Mannikin and wife, Ogly,
Ireland. This was the manner in which the hurried clerk
of the hotel had heard and entered the name and address
of The O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The attendant physician gave his certificate as to the
natural cause of death, so that there was no need of a
coroner’s inquest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there had to be a thorough search made through the
effects of the dead woman for clews to friends or relatives,
who should be notified of her decease.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing was found; not a letter, not even a line of writing
except those of the receipts, for she had paid punctually
every week up to the Saturday before her fatal illness. The
poor young pair had no correspondents anywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor was there any money found. Her very last dollar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>had been paid away for her last week’s board, and there
was nothing left to satisfy the claims of the doctor or the
nurse, to pay the funeral expenses or to provide for the
orphan twins.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no end of gossip in the house. Dress, fashion,
operas, even mining stocks were temporarily forgotten in
the discussion of this sad and strange event. It was then
decided among the worldly wise that the name Mannikin
was only an assumed one, that the husband had deserted the
wife, or more probably, the destroyer had abandoned his
prey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Human nature, sinful as it is called, is nowhere quite
heartless.</p>

<p class='c009'>A purse was made up among the people of the house to
defray the expenses of the young stranger’s funeral. And
on the fifth day after her death her remains were laid in the
Lone Mountain Cemetery.</p>

<p class='c009'>The motherless babes were taken in charge by the
monthly nurse, a Mrs. Mally, who, in a fit of benevolence
that did not last long, adopted them and carried them to
her own home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The personal effects of the poor dead young mother,
which were not of much value indeed, but which might have
been detained by the proprietors of the hotel for the last
few days of unpaid board, were given by them into the
keeping of Nurse Mally, either for the benefit of the babes
or of any claimant who might prove to have the best right
to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the ministering physician, like most of the men of
his humane profession, he waived all claim to remuneration
for his services.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mally soon found the pursuit of her own regular
calling and the care of the orphaned infants too much for
her “nerves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sin is the outcome of so many causes—hereditary, taint,
faulty training, temptation and opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mally was affected by all these. She slowly made
up her mind to keep the dead mother’s wardrobe, trinkets
and books and to dispose of the babies. She would not hurt
them; not for the world! But she would put them in a
haven where, in truth, they would be much better taken care
of than by any poor, hard-working woman like herself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>So one evening she dressed them in their very best clothes
and gave them each a dose of paregoric, not enough to endanger
their little lives—she knew her business too well for
that—but to put them into a deep sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it was dark she got a large market basket with a
strong handle, folded a clean cradle blanket and laid it in
the bottom of it, took another little blanket and laid it in
loose so that its edges came up over those of the receptacle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she wrapped the sleeping babies up carefully, put
them in the bottom, laid comfortably at each end with their
feet passing each other in the middle, covered them over
with the double folds of the upper blanket, and so done up
like a pastry cook’s turn-over pie, she took them in the
basket on her arm and carried them out into the dimly
lighted back streets and off into the country to the infant
asylum of the Holy Maternity. She had not far to go.
When she reached the gate, which stood always open for
the reception of such piteous little human waifs as infant
outcasts, she went in and up to the gable end of the
building, where stood the cage to receive the poor, naked,
fatherless, motherless human birdlings. It was a large oriel
window, about breast high from the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>She rang the bell at the side of the window. It swung
open and around, bearing attached on its inner side a soft,
warm nest, or small cradle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mally took the sleeping infants from the basket, one
by one, and placed them in the nest, tucked them snugly
in, put the two cradle blankets, folded, over them, and
then rang the bell again. The window-sash with the nest
swung round and inward, and so the abandoned babes were
received within the sheltering arm of the “Holy Maternity,”
and no questions asked. We know the rest of their lives
so far as they have yet lived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mally went home with her empty basket, and that
night missed the babes so much that she wept with contrition
and loneliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day she hunted up every article of infant wear
belonging to the twins, washed and ironed all that was
soiled, then packed them into the basket, and when night
came she went once more to the asylum and rang at the
receiving window. Again the nest swung outward, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>put into it, no baby, but a quantity of babies’ clothing, then
rang the bell again and the offering was swung inward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Mrs. Mally went home with the empty basket, relieved.</p>

<p class='c009'>During all this time The O’Melaghlin lay ill of a long,
lingering fever in the mining camp under the shadow of the
great Black Rock Ridges.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had not been utterly unsuccessful during the first days
of trial before he succumbed to the fierce onset of his disease.
He was as kindly cared for by his companions as circumstances
would permit. He had no orthodox medical attendance.
A Mexican Indian, an herb doctress, came and
nursed him. Her simple ministrations, with the aid of pure
air, pure water, nature and a good constitution, saved his
life.</p>

<p class='c009'>But his great mental trouble of anxiety to see or hear
from his young wife, left alone in the city hotel, tended to
retard his recovery, which was very tedious.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mates had prospered in their search for gold. The
mine promised to hold out, and not run out as so many did.
So, finding that the sick man’s anxiety to see his young
wife far outweighed his craving for the gold mine, they
made up a liberal purse among themselves to send him on
his way rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as he was able to walk he set out on foot from
the mining camp. He was accompanied half a day’s journey
by a couple of his companions, who brought him as far
as a friendly Indian’s hut and there bade him good-by, leaving
him to rest for the afternoon and spend the night, while
they retraced their steps to the mining camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early the next morning The O’Melaghlin resumed his
journey and dragged himself by slow stages of ten or fifteen
miles a day, stopping at night in miner’s, hunter’s or Indian’s
hut, according as either offered shelter near the close
of evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so at length he reached the city late one autumn
night, and went straight to the hotel where he had left his
young wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>There he learned that she had been dead and buried for
more than a month past, and that the twins to which she
had given birth were in the care of the professional nurse,
Mrs. Mandy Mally, of Cyprus Lane.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>But he scarcely heard this last item of intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shock of the first fatal news, coming as it did after
the wasting of his long illness and the weariness of his long
tramp, quite overwhelmed The O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>He fell senseless to the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was taken up and sent to the casual ward of a public
hospital, where he suffered a severe relapse that confined
him to his bed for many weeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon his second recovery, as soon as he was discharged
from the hospital he went in search of the monthly nurse
who had taken charge of poor Moira’s babes.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found the woman in a very small house in a very
narrow back street.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked scared when she was confronted with the
father of the children whom she had sent away.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she soon recovered her self-control. She told him
how she had disposed of the children, and excused herself
by calling his attention to the poverty of herself, her house
and her surroundings, and to the necessity of her going out
to work.</p>

<p class='c009'>The O’Melaghlin accepted all her apologies. He did not
blame her in the least. He thought it best for the children
to be under the care of the Sisterhood of the Holy Maternity;
and he told her so.</p>

<p class='c009'>He left the nurse, and went out to find some cheap lodgings
where he could hide himself and his misery for a few
days until he should be able to come to some understanding
with himself and strike out some plan for the future.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wished to go and see his children at the asylum, and
yet he dreaded the trial; he could not get up resolution to do
so. They had been the cause—though the innocent one—of
their mother’s death, and so he shrank from looking upon
their infant faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides, the pride of The O’Melaghlin winced at the
thought of going and facing the Sisters of that house and
owning himself the father of those destitute infants, without
either taking them away at once or making some provision
for their support in the institution; and he could neither
take charge of them himself nor provide for them anywhere.
He was at this time too bitterly poor.</p>

<p class='c009'>No, he said to himself, he could do no better for the
children than to leave them there in that safe, happy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Christian home. He would keep track of them, he told
himself, and if ever he should be able he would take them
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>And without ever having looked upon the faces of his
children he left California for Australia, shipping himself
as a man before the mast on a large merchantman bound
from San Francisco to Sydney.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must hasten over the remainder of The O’Melaghlin’s
story.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the day of his embarkation for Australia he became
a wanderer over the face of the earth, chiefly among the
mines. His gold fever, suspended for a time by his grief
for the loss of his wife, revived with tenfold force, so that
“the last state of that man was worse than the first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He visited Australia, Tasmania, the Sandwich Islands,
New Zealand, Cape Colony and other places, but finally
returned to Australia, where at last he found fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the mere accident of idly poking his staff in the
ground one day while sitting down to rest, on his way
through the bush, he struck ore—rich gold—that turned
out one of the greatest mines in that region.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be tedious to tell all the processes by which he
realized a colossal fortune, or by what slow degrees he returned
to the worthy ambition of his youth to restore the
fortunes of his family by repurchasing, at any advance of
price, their lost land, and rebuilding, at any cost, their
ruined castle.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had renewed his resolution to do all this, he first
thought of getting married to perpetuate the house of
O’Melaghlin—although at this period of his life he was not
at all a marrying man, preferring “the free, unhoused condition”
of a bachelor. Then suddenly he recalled to mind
his deserted and almost forgotten children. If these were
living he had a son and a daughter to carry down his name
to the future; for should his son be dead and his girl living,
whoever should marry the heiress of The O’Melaghlin must
take the name of O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, should either of his long neglected children be living,
he need not be driven to get married at all—which would
be a great relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>He settled up all his affairs in Australia and sailed for
California.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>When he reached San Francisco he went immediately to
the asylum where his children had been received.</p>

<p class='c009'>I need not follow the father in every step of the weary
search he had in tracing them from the asylum to their
places of apprenticeship; from these places—with the aid of
skilful detectives—to the mining camp of Grizzly Gulch,
from that to the fort and thence to New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>In New York, from the Wallings, he heard the most satisfactory
news of both, but especially of the daughter, who, he
was told, had married a wealthy young Englishman of
ancient family and of large landed estate, and who had
gone to England with her husband, taking her brother
along with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Walling could not give the inquiring father the address
of the young people, whom he believed to be somewhere
in London, living quietly, and pursuing their studies
to make up for their long neglected education.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he referred The O’Melaghlin to Mr. Cleve Stuart, of
Wolfscliff, West Virginia, who would be able to satisfy him
on every point.</p>

<p class='c009'>The O’Melaghlin, having nearly four weeks of time on
hand before the sailing of the steamer, which was the first
on which he could secure a passage to Liverpool, resolved,
instead of writing for information from Mr. Stuart, to go
down to Wolfscliff and have a personal interview with the
parties who had been intimate with his son and daughter,
and who would be able to give him every particular of their
character, personal appearance and history.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so, as has been seen, he came to Wolfscliff.</p>

<p class='c009'>The O’Melaghlin was deeply pleased with every circumstance
of his reception there; with the cordial welcome of
the young master and mistress of the house, with the discovery
which he honestly thought he had made of a worthy
kinsman in the person of Cleve Stuart, a descendant, as
O’Melaghlin himself claimed to be, on his mother’s side, of
the royal house of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c009'>But more than all was he pleased with the account he
heard from his host and hostess of his long neglected son
and daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will be hearing from these young people every week,
will ye not, Wolfscliff?” he inquired that evening, after having
finished his story.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>“My wife hears from her cousin Judith by almost every
English mail,” answered Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you’ll be getting a letter in a day or so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, most likely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, of course, answering it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course! That is, my wife will! As I hinted before,
the correspondence of the two families is kept up by Palma
and Judith.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! So then you are the scribe, Mistress Stuart?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” answered Palma, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you are thinking, ma’am, what a grand piece of
news you will have to tell your friend in your very next
letter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, I am thinking of just such a delight!” exclaimed
Palma, her eyes fairly dancing with anticipation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I am almost sorry to debar you from such a pleasure,
ma’am, but I must beseech you not to make known my
existence to my son and daughter until we meet them in
England face to face,” said O’Melaghlin solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Palma, with a look of great disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have good reasons for my request, and I will tell them
to you. Your husband, my friend Wolfscliff there, will understand
them. I wish to be introduced to the young ones
simply as The O’Melaghlin. They have probably never
heard that name before in all their lives. They can never
suspect its connection with themselves——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do I understand you really, O’Melaghlin? Do you wish
to be presented as a stranger to your own son and daughter?”
inquired Stuart in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is just exactly what I do wish,” replied the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why?” inquired Stuart, while Palma looked the
same question with great, dilated eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the first place, I wish to make a quiet observation of
them while yet they consider me a mere ordinary, uninteresting
stranger, with whom they can be at perfect ease, and
show themselves as they really are with perfect freedom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But don’t you suppose they could do that with their own
father, knowing him to be their father who had come to
seek them out, to find them, to make up to them—and to
himself as well—for their long separation from him—don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>you suppose they could feel at ease and act with freedom
in the presence of such a father?” demanded Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I don’t!” emphatically retorted The O’Melaghlin.
“Under the circumstances, I don’t believe they could either
feel easy or behave naturally. They would be so surprised,
so amazed——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if they were carefully prepared for the meeting
beforehand,” suggested Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I doubt if you could prepare them for so strange a meeting.
But granting that you could, still they would be so
filled with wonder and curiosity, so anxious to do their duty,
so eager to make a good impression, that, as I said before,
it would be impossible for them to feel comfortably or behave
naturally. No, you must present me to your friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hay, simply as your kinsman, The
O’Melaghlin of Arghalee. You may write and ask permission
to bring your kinsman to Haymore Hall,” concluded
the chieftain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would not be necessary to ask permission. Indeed, it
would hurt my friend Ran for me to do so. He would have
us all treat his house as our own and bring whom we
pleased, without ceremony, taking much more than his permission
for granted, even taking his delight to welcome any
of our friends, for granted,” replied Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, then, sure he is a whole-souled, great-hearted fellow,
this husband of my Judy! This son-in-law of my own!
And I shall be proud to make his acquaintance. Troth,
he should have been an Irishman!” warmly exclaimed
The O’Melaghlin. “And now,” he added, turning suddenly
around to Palma, “do you understand, ma’am, why I wish
to meet my son and daughter as a stranger, and to observe
them for a whole day or an evening before making myself
known to them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly, Mr. O’Melaghlin. And I think you are quite
right,” warmly responded Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you, ma’am, for your indorsement of my judgment.
And now, my dear young lady, will you oblige me in
one small matter?” he gravely inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In anything, great or small, that lies within my power,
Mr. O’Melaghlin,” smiled Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, my dear young lady, will you graciously drop the
‘mister’ before my name?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Palma looked up in questioning surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will explain, my dear madam. The O’Melaghlins have
been The O’Melaghlins from time immemorial, as I had
the honor to tell you before. They were monarchs of Meath
for many centuries; but they were never ‘mister,’ like any
ordinary Smith, Jones, or Brown, or Anybody. So, my fair
kinswoman, you will please to oblige me by dropping that
little prefix to my old historic name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Mr.—I beg pardon. But, sir, if I must not call you
‘mister,’ how shall I address you or speak of you?” inquired
the bewildered young woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Simply as O’Melaghlin, or The O’Melaghlin. My dear,
how would you speak of or address Julius Cæsar, Marc Antony,
or Alexander the Great? Would you say ‘Mr.’ Julius
Cæsar? ‘Mr.’ Marc Antony? No, you would not. And
no more should you say Mr. O’Melaghlin. There are family
names, my dear lady, that outrank not only the little prefix
of ‘mister,’ but all titles, and such a name is that of The
O’Melaghlin,” solemnly concluded the chieftain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, O’Melaghlin,” laughed Palma, “I will hereafter
always remember to call you O’Melaghlin, though, indeed,
it will make me feel like a very fast young woman,
and just as if I had a jockey cap on my head and a cigar
in my mouth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish to be enlightened,” said Stuart, with a smile.
“You call me ‘Wolfscliff.’ Why, upon the same principle,
do you not call yourself Arghalee?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chieftain drew himself up with a royal air and replied
majestically:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, sir, The O’Melaghlin ranks the territorial title
of Arghalee, as it ranks every other title!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does not the royal name of Stuart rank Wolfscliff?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would; but there are thousands of Stuarts, and you
are only one of them, and derive your individual distinction
from your manor. You are Stuart, of Wolfscliff. There
is but one O’Melaghlin. I am The O’Melaghlin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your son?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is Michael O’Melaghlin. When he succeeds me he
will be The O’Melaghlin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see!” said Stuart, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I doubt if he did see.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXV<br> <span class='large'>AN ANGEL’S WORK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The nest day Palma had a final and decisive talk with
Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>In such high esteem was this good woman held by the
young Stuarts that they regarded her almost as a mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the question of going to England that summer was
first mooted, the alternative was placed before Mrs. Pole,
and the choice given, her to accompany the young pair on
their voyage and foreign tour or to remain at Wolfscliff in
charge of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the woman, on her part, had entreated Mr. and Mrs.
Stuart to tell her which they would prefer to have her do.</p>

<p class='c009'>To which they replied that they wished her to do just as
she pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>This morning Palma came into the nursery, where Mrs.
Pole sat beside the cradle, watching the sleeping babies,
while she sewed on some plain needlework.</p>

<p class='c009'>How for the last fortnight Mrs. Pole had been halting
between two opinions, divided between the affections for
Cleve and Palma and their children, that drew to go with
them, and her dread of the long voyage and love of quiet
that bound her to her home. Therefore, she wished them to
make the decision for her that she was incapable of making
for herself. And they would not.</p>

<p class='c009'>But within a day or two it had been “borne in” upon the
mind of Poley that, although Mr. and Mrs. Stuart really
wished her to do as she pleased in this matter of going or
staying, yet that they would be better satisfied that she
should please to stay at Wolfscliff to take care of the house
than to go to Europe with them. Mrs. Pole and her young
friends were really secretly of one mind in this matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>So when Palma sat down beside her she was prepared to
meet the question.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poley, dear, it is really time now that you should make
up your mind as to what you are going to do about going
to Europe with us or staying here. Because, if you should
decide to go with us, Poley, dear, we must begin at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>to look out for some good and reliable woman to come and
take care of the house while we are away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my dear child, you needn’t trouble yourself to look
out for nobody. If it is all the same to you, I will my own
self stay here and look after the place while you are gone.
Will that suit you, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly, Poley, dear. We would rather leave you in
charge of our home than any one else, if you are satisfied
to stay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I am, dearie. I’m over elderly to be sailing on the
high seas, and nothing but my love for you all would ever
a-made me think of such a thing. And now, as I find I
can serve you better by staying here than going ’long o’ you,
why, ’deed, I’d heap liefer stay here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it is all right, Poley. And now tell me, when
did you hear from your niece?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jane Morgan, you mean, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, Jane Morgan. I did not know you had any
other niece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No more I hadn’t, ma’am. Well, I heard from her ’bout
two weeks ago. He have been out of work near all the latter
part o’ the winter, and they’ve been a-having of a very hard
time, ma’am, and that is a fact, with all the mouves they’ve
got to feed, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How many children have they, Poley?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Six, ma’am. The oldest nine years old, and the youngest
nine months. And he out of work so long, poor fellow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should have told me, Poley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for, ma’am? You couldn’t have helped it. I sent
’em a good part of my wages, and that kept ’em a-going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poley, do you remember that I told you your niece
should come here and bring all her babies this summer to
see you and to get the benefit of this pure mountain air?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, ma’am, indeed I do remember!” exclaimed Mrs.
Pole, brightening up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And have you written to your niece about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, ma’am. As you never mentioned the subject
again after that first time, I didn’t know but what you had
forgotten it or changed your mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Poley! How could you? Well, now, look here.
Write to your niece and tell her to come and bring all her
children down here to spend the summer with you while we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>are gone to Europe. And I hope they will come, Poley. It
would do the little children so much good. And, oh! is Mr.
Morgan out of work now, Poley?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was two weeks ago, ma’am, with no prospect of getting
any.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is his trade?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is a carpenter and builder, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, then I do think we shall be able to do a good thing
for him. Such a good thing for him!” exclaimed Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole looked up in mute surprise and inquiry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, this is it. You know there is ever so much carpenter’s
work wanting to be done on the place. I have heard
Cleve talking about it. The barn is to be almost rebuilt, and
the house here wants repairs. Cleve thought of getting a
carpenter down from Staunton. But now, you see, I shall
just ask him to send for Mr. Morgan. And then they can
all come down here—husband, wife and children! Won’t
that be glorious, Poley? And he will not lose his time, and
they will not be under expenses!” cried Palma in delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be very fine indeed, ma’am, if so be it can
be managed,” replied Mrs. Pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then she began to compute how much it would cost
to bring Joseph and Jane Morgan and their family from
New York to West Virginia, and to count up her own
savings from her wages.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can do it,” she said to herself. “I can do it! And
they can pay me afterward as they get on, and if they don’t
they needn’t bother about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma went straight to Cleve and unfolded her views.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, dear,” she said, after she had duly introduced
the subject, “I did give Poley leave to ask her niece and
the children to come down here and stay with her while we
should be away in Europe; for, oh! only think how much
good it will do those poor little children! And now since
the husband and father is a carpenter and a skilled workman,
as Poley says he is, what could happen better for all
parties? You can engage him to do the work here that is
so much wanted. And it will be such a good thing for him
and his family as well as for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear quixotic Palma, your benevolence carries you
into wild extravagance, I fear,” said Stuart, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was only thinking of the poor man—a skilled mechanic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>too, out of employment—and of his poor, overtasked
wife and their poor little children. I know it is an unusual
thing to do to bring down a whole family when one only
wants a carpenter. But then, you see, the circumstances are
also unusual, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the little woman who plans the arrangements is not
only unusual, but—phenomenal!” Stuart said, interrupting
her, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cleve, listen to me, dear, and be serious, for I am.
I said the circumstances were unusual, and so they are.
We are going to Europe, and this old house among the hills
would be nearly empty while we are gone, and Mrs. Pole
would be alone except for the negro servants on the place
unless we should let her have some one to stay with her.
Now these people are her nearest relations. I promised
her that they should come and visit her. They are in bitter
want of all that the change would bring them—and, oh,
dear me, Cleve!” she suddenly broke off, “we are not living
in this world all for ourselves! And don’t you think it
would be a sin, and we should be worse than the dog in the
manger to leave this big old house among the hills almost
empty when we go away instead of opening it to that poor,
half-starved and half-stifled tenement family whose children
would here have fresh air, pure water and good food, and
who would get health and strength and delight in this beautiful
place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Palma, dear, you talk to me as if I had to be
argued into consenting to this arrangement. It is enough,
love, that you wish to have it made,” said Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is very kind of you, Cleve; but I wished to convince,
not to coax you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A distinction without a difference in this case, dear.
Well, I will see to this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The only hesitation Stuart felt was as to the character of
the man Morgan, of whom neither Palma nor himself knew
anything. But Mrs. Pole did know, and Stuart resolved to
have a talk with the woman, in whose honesty and judgment
he had equal and entire confidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later in the day he questioned Mrs. Pole, and when she
assured Mr. Stuart that “he”—she always referred to her
nephew-in-law by the pronoun instead of his name—“he”
was honest, temperate and industrious as a man could be,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>and his only fault was carelessness about saving money
when he had it, though he never wasted it on himself, but
on the young ones, even to the extravagance of an excursion
sometimes. But for that, “he” was as good and trusty a
man as ever wore shoe leather.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon this information Stuart acted, and wrote a letter
to Mr. Morgan offering him work for the summer, with
good wages and his expenses paid to West Virginia if he
should accept the terms. This business letter inclosed two
others, one from Palma to Mrs. Morgan, explaining circumstances
and asking her as a favor to come with Mr. Morgan
and bring all their children and stay at Wolfscliff with Mrs.
Pole for the whole summer and part of the autumn, while
Mr. Stuart and she (the writer) should be in Europe. The
last letter was from Mrs. Pole to her niece, imploring her
not to be “backward” in accepting the lady’s invitation,
which was made in good faith and in the earnest desire to
do them service.</p>

<p class='c009'>These letters, inclosed in one envelope, were sent off by
that day’s mail.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within seven days the answer came. One from Morgan
to Mr. Stuart, gratefully accepting the liberal terms offered
him; one from Jane Morgan to Mrs. Stuart, overflowing
with delight and thankfulness, and telling the lady, what
Palma appreciated best of all, that her children were “fairly
standing on their heads in delight at the thought of their
going into the country,” and one from the niece to her aunt,
breathing of gratitude to the Giver of all good gifts for
this blessing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart sent on his check to Morgan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole began active preparations for the reception of
her niece and the children.</p>

<p class='c009'>The large bedroom on the ground floor which had once
been the private apartment of old Mr. Cleve, and two
smaller rooms in the rear of that were fitted up for the
family.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because,” said Palma, “these rooms all open upon the
back porch and the end porch, and will be so convenient for
the little children to run in and out without danger of falling
from any height or hurting themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole was ready to cry with the feeling of the young
woman’s tender, thoughtful kindness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Palma was busy also with her own preparations. It was
no very easy matter to pack trunks for her husband, her
children and herself for a voyage to Europe. It would
have been a much harder task but that Cleve continually
reminded her that she really needed to take no more than
they might require on their voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To carry clothes to Europe is to ‘carry coals to Newcastle,’”
he said, quoting an old proverb.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hatty, to her great delight, was selected from all the
other servants to go with them as lady’s maid and children’s
nurse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last week of their stay at Wolfscliff came. And the
program for that week was all laid out.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Sunday they all went to church together.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Monday Mr. and Mrs. Cleve Stuart gave a dinner
party at Wolfscliff in honor of their guest, The O’Melaghlin,
and for which the invitations had been given out several
days previous. This was a great success. All the family
connections of the Stuarts and the Cleves were on hand, and
The O’Melaghlin was in great force, notwithstanding, or
perhaps just because, he had taken a great deal more wine
than was good for him. But in this respect he was kept well
in countenance by the elders of that dinner table; for up to
this time the total abstinence movement had not reached
that neighborhood, where the heads of old families kept up
the convivial habits of their forefathers.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Tuesday, by appointment, Mr. Stuart sent the large
carryall and also the ox cart to Wolfswalk to meet the Morgans,
who were expected to arrive that afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>After their dispatch the whole household of Wolfscliff
was in a state of expectancy much more delightful at the
anticipation of meeting the poor workman’s family of small
children who would be in such ecstasies at their visit than
they would have been in looking forward to the arrival of
the most distinguished party this country could afford.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was quite late at night when the two lumbering
vehicles drew up before the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The O’Melaghlin had retired to rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart had remained in the drawing-room under silent
protest, until Palma entreated, exhorted and commanded,
using all the forms of the potential mood in order to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>him go to bed. Then he laughed and yielded, and Palma
and Mrs. Pole “stayed up” to receive the travelers.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had a nice supper, also, ready for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>So when they heard the wheels grate on the pebbles before
the house both rushed out of the room just in time to
see old ’Sias, who alone of all the servants shared their
watch, unbolt and unbar the great double front door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the door was opened and the large party filed in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma withdrew to the background to let Mrs. Pole offer
the first greetings to her relatives. First came Joe, with
one child fast asleep on his shoulder, and another, half
asleep, holding his hand by his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came Jane, with the baby in her arms and two
little girls clinging to her skirts, and the eldest boy close
behind her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole received them one by one, kissing them in tears
of joy, and with disconnected, inarticulate words of welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of this little hubbub the carryall and ox
cart were heard to start again and roll away in the direction
of the barnyard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Pole presented them all, one by one, to Palma, who
received each with great kindness, and took the baby to hold
in her arms, while its mother, father and all the other children
followed Mrs. Pole into the bedrooms to take off their
wraps and wash for supper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came the comfortable supper and the chat that accompanied
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palma felt fully compensated for her “quixotism.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When they all bade her good-night and went to their
rooms on the ground floor Palma felt too joyful to retire;
so she stayed up talking to Mrs. Pole until midnight, and
then—even then—when she retired to bed, she was too happy
to sleep—too happy in the thought of the happiness she

<p class='c009'>The next morning must have reconciled a more hard-headed
man that Cleve Stuart to the quixotism of his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lawn resounded with the shouts and laughter of the
little children, who might have thought, if young children
ever think, that they had died in their tenement house and
waked up in heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stuart was as much pleased with the frank, honest face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>and manner of Joseph Morgan as Palma was with the true,
tender, motherly countenance and conversation of Jane
Morgan.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br> <span class='large'>GENTLEMAN GEFF’S FATE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Gentleman Geff was in a profound stupor when he was
taken to the rectory and put to bed in the best chamber of
the house—the parlor bedroom on the ground floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>He continued in this state for several days, faithfully
watched by Elspeth and Longman, and frequently visited
by Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, and daily attended by Dr.
Hobbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie shrank from even going to look at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he recognized no one, noticed nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Medicine and highly concentrated nourishment were
regularly administered to him by his nurses.</p>

<p class='c009'>These he sometimes swallowed instinctively, mechanically,
and at other times choked over, and had to be raised in
bed and have his throat relieved and his mouth wiped like
a helpless baby; but all unconsciously on his part. He
never knew, or seemed to know, what he himself was suffering,
or other people were doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>His spirit was away, away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where?</p>

<p class='c009'>In Hades, most probably, judging from his antecedents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will he die in this stupor, or come out of it, do you
think, sir?” inquired the rector of the doctor one morning
as the two men stood by the bedside of the patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Hobbs never “shook his head;” doctors never do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>such stupidly disheartening things over a case, however
serious—story writers to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>This physician also had the courage to confess that he
was not omniscient, for he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if he should come out of this stupor, will he be
likely to live?” inquired the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know,” again replied the doctor. “I shall be
better able to judge when he recovers consciousness, if he
should ever recover it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the physician wrote his prescriptions and instructions
for the treatment of the ill man and retired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one word of this talk entered the consciousness of
Gentleman Geff.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nine days he lay in this condition, and then there passed
over him a change.</p>

<p class='c009'>He seemed to himself to be groping feebly out of nothingness
into vague consciousness of horror; but what the
horror was, or what he himself was, he did not even think.
The first effort to do so sent him back into the state from
which he had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a few hours he came again out of utter oblivion
into some faint consciousness of himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>But who was he? Where was he?</p>

<p class='c009'>All was dark and still around him. Then came faint intelligence,
with imperfect memory, which mingled dreams
with distorted facts. He remembered faintly what he would
have called “a row,” but where, or under what circumstances,
he could not find; he thought it was a drunken
brawl over cards in a gambling saloon, and some one had
crushed in his brain and killed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, that was it! He had been killed last night in a
drunken brawl over cards, in a gambling saloon, and now
he had come to life——</p>

<p class='c009'>Where?</p>

<p class='c009'>In that dark lower world, without sun, moon or stars;
without air, water or vegetation; that world of horror and
despair of which he had heard in childhood, but in which he
had never believed, and where he must wait with thieves
and murderers and miscreants like himself until the general
judgment day; and after that——</p>

<p class='c009'>What?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>The eternal life of torture in the lake of fire and brimstone
in which he had never believed, either in its literal or
in its metaphorical meaning.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now he was too utterly debilitated in mind and body
to know or to feel anything very clearly or deeply.</p>

<p class='c009'>He relapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he came to himself the next time he was able to
think with a little more clearness, and to recollect with
more correctness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He remembered now that it was at Haymore Hall the
“row” had occurred, in which he still believed he had been
knocked down and had succumbed to his injuries, and had
now waked up in the world of darkness, horror and despair,
to wait for his final doom.</p>

<p class='c009'>His final doom?</p>

<p class='c009'>He moaned in his helplessness, not altogether from fear
of future hell, but from a feeling of present thirst, intolerable
even as the rich man suffered when he cried to
Father Abraham to send Lazarus to dip his finger in water
and cool his parched tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had moaned a second time he felt the approach
of some huge, dark form. It stood by him, it bent over him,
put out a strong arm under his shoulders and lifted him,
and placed a glassful of a refreshing beverage to his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>He drank and breathed more freely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah! how delicious it was!</p>

<p class='c009'>The attendant replaced his head on the pillow, smoothed
his bedclothes and withdrew to take away the glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment he came back, bent over the still half-comatose
man and inquired softly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you feel, Capt. Montgomery?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I—I—feel——” muttered Gentleman Geff, and
then swooned into the slumber of weakness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some one silently opened the door and came in. It was
the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is your patient, Longman?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, he has just swallowed more liquid than he has since
he has been ill; and he has spoken for the first time,” replied
the nurse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coherently?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>“Well, not much. I asked him how he felt, as an experiment,
you see, sir, and to find out whether he could understand
anything; and he did understand, for he began to
tell me, and he dropped off to sleep. You see he is sleeping
naturally, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I see. Well, Longman, it is one o’clock. Go to
bed. I will relieve your watch,” said the rector, sinking
into the large easy-chair beside the patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman made some resistance to this proposal, but Mr.
Campbell was firm, and sent off the wearied nurse to take
his much needed rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ill man rested well for some hours, and then moaned
in his sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>The watcher gave him a cooling and strengthening beverage,
just as Longman had done, and the patient sank again
into sleep, muttering:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t be in hell, after all, for in hell no one comes
from heaven to put a cool——” Then his words became
inaudible until he dropped into unconsciousness with the
last word—“purgatory”—on his failing tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the remainder of the night he slept well, only occasionally
muttering in his sleep:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in hell, after all—only in purgatory—not such a
bad place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the morning when the doctor came to make his daily
visit he found the ill man sleeping quietly and Mr. Campbell
and Longman sitting by his bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He examined the patient’s pulse and temperature without
waking him, and then took the two watchers’ report.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Took nourishment with a relish and spoke consciously—both
good signs, excellent signs! but I can say no more at
present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor wrote out the formulas for the day and took
leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>All that day Gentleman Geff remained in the same condition
without a sign of further improvement. All the following
night Longman had a repetition of the experience
of the preceding night. At dawn his mother, Elspeth, relieved
him and sent him to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the family breakfast Mr. Campbell came in and
sent Elspeth out to get her own coffee and muffins. The
sick-room was still kept very dark by the doctor’s orders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Darkness, he said, was the best sedative for nerves and
brain in the condition of Capt. Montgomery.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the sick man showed by moaning and moving uneasily
that he was awake, the rector took some beef tea
that was kept hot over a spirit lamp, poured it into an invalid’s
feeding-glass and administered it to the patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff sucked it in with a relish, and then sank
back on his pillow with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mr. Campbell had put away the cup and returned
to his seat by the bedside he was startled by hearing the
patient inquire:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who the devil are you, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He answered calmly, however:</p>

<p class='c009'>“One whom you should know, Capt. Montgomery. I am
James Campbell, rector of——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was interrupted by an exclamation from Gentleman
Geff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The devil you say! The curate of Medge in purgatory!
a parson in purgatory! When did your reverence die?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector paused a few moments before he replied, and
then he spoke very quietly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not dead, nor likely to die; nor are you in purgatory
as you seem to think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! are you living?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I thank Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And—I living also?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! And I say thank Heaven for you also.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are we, then?” questioned the man in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>But before the rector could answer his question, and even
while the question was on his lips, Gentleman Geff had
fainted into forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>In his struggling soul, striving back to consciousness from
his long stupor, the wretched man had been the victim of
three several hallucinations.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, that he was dead and buried, and while in that
state he made no sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>Second, that he was in hell, and then his wail for water and
the drink that was given him dispelled the illusion,
which was replaced by the fancy that he was in purgatory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the meeting with the living James Campbell had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>cured him of that delusion also, and left him to one more
natural but not the less painful.</p>

<p class='c009'>When next he awoke from temporary oblivion his brain
was clearer and his memory more accurate than either had
yet been since his illness; still, both were somewhat clouded,
so that they mixed up time and space, and dreams and realities
in weird phantasmagoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>For instance, he remembered every detail of the two murders
he thought he had committed, but not an item of the
meeting with his two intended victims living to accuse him,
not of murder, but of attempted murder.</p>

<p class='c009'>And without reflecting, or being now able to reflect, that
he could not possibly be hung in England for murders committed
in America, he now thought that he was in the condemned
cell of an English prison, waiting for speedy execution;
that the huge giant who loomed through the shadows
of the prison was his death watch, and that James Campbell
had come to him in his clerical capacity to prepare him for
death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I will not allow him to worm any confession out of
me. I have been convicted on the frailest circumstantial
evidence, and they dare not hang me at the last. I will
have nothing to do with the parson. I won’t even know
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the most coherent thought that Gentleman Geff
had formed since he sank into stupor in the drawing-room
of Haymore Hall. But the instinct of self-preservation is
a wonderful stimulant to the brain.</p>

<p class='c009'>So when James Campbell came next to him he turned
his face to the wall and would not notice him.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Longman came and gave him food and asked how
he felt he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to see my lawyer. Send him here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman, who had been directed to humor all his whims,
replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, sir. He shall be summoned immediately.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And don’t let that parson come near me again. I hate
parsons. And if he thinks he is going to nag me into confessing
crimes I never even dreamed of committing he must
be a much bigger fool than ever I took him to be. Send my
lawyer to me, do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>“Well, then, why the devil don’t you do it? You needn’t
keep such an infernal sharp lookout on me. I am not going
to commit suicide, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman laughed and left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff turned with his face to the wall and tried
to remember the details of his supposed trial—what the
lawyers had said, what “his honor” said, how he, the prisoner
at the bar, had behaved; and then, failing to remember
anything of what had never occurred, his diseased brain
took to imagining a whole drama, in which he formed the
central figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor came in the same morning, felt his pulse and
asked him how he had slept.</p>

<p class='c009'>“None the better for you and your quackeries,” was the
reply. “And if I am supposed to be sick enough to have a
physician, why the devil am I not sent to a hospital, and
not kept in this wretched hole?” he added, still believing
himself to be in the condemned cell of the Chuxton jail.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, don’t they treat you well here?” pleasantly inquired
Dr. Hobbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Gentleman Geff disdained to reply and turned his
face to the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor rose to take leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think the man is getting along very well; much better
than I ever thought that he would.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think he is an ungrateful beast!” exclaimed Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you must not judge him harshly. His head is not
clear yet. He does not know friends from foes,” replied the
doctor, who knew nothing whatever of Gentleman Geff’s
criminal career, so well had the secret been kept by those
who possessed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman did not answer in words; but his grim silence
was sufficiently expressive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now you may let a little more light in the room
and give him a more varied diet,” was the parting instruction
of the physician.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the latter had gone and the door closed behind
him Longman returned to the bedside of his charge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff was sleeping, or seemed to be so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman went and opened the shutters of one window,
but drew down the white linen shade and let fall the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>lace curtains. This filled the chamber with a soft, subdued
light.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman was getting to be an experienced nurse, and
knew that it would not be well to startle the patient, who
had lived so long in shadows, with too bright a light.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had arranged the room to his satisfaction he resumed
his seat at the bedside, and fell into the reflection
that, notwithstanding all the unbelief and hardness of heart
that degrade this age of the world, there were still some
good Christian people who lived by the golden rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the midst of these reflections he was startled by seeing
Gentleman Geff turn over to the front of the bed and stare
out through the opening of his festooned white curtains.
His eyes took in the soft, dim outlines of a moonlight-looking
room, though it was now really midday, and the
white window shade and the white lace curtains produced
the lunar effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this soft effulgence he saw that the room was very
spacious, and had four lace-curtained windows, and a lovely
lace-draped dressing-table, soft, white, dimity-covered chairs
and sofa, and pretty Turkey rugs upon a polished yellow
oak floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The richly carved marble mantelpiece, with its large
mirror, Sèvres vases and terra cotta statuettes, and the polished
steel stove, with its glowing but flameless fire of hard
coal, was hidden from his sight by a tall Japan screen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything in the apartment bespoke wealth, culture and
luxury.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff stared until his eyes stood out from their
sockets. Then he muttered to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is not a prison cell, nor yet any hospital ward; yet
this man sitting here must be the same Giant Despair who
was with me in jail. There can’t be two of that size in the
same country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman stood up and stooped over him, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I do anything for you, Capt. Montgomery?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it is you! I thought there couldn’t be two of you
in the same century, on the same planet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can I do for you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound you! you can explain things, I suppose. You
can tell we where the devil I am now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are at the rectory of Haymore parish, sir, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>you were brought on the night of that unfortunate”—Longman
paused a moment for an inoffensive word, and then
added—“disturbance at Haymore Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Disturbance—at Haymore Hall!” muttered the criminal,
growing pale as ashes and sinking back upon his pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>No revelation yet had struck him so heavily as this. And
it brought back a more exact memory, though not yet a perfect
one, of the recent past.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman hurried to the other end of the room and returned
with a powerful restorative.</p>

<p class='c009'>He held Gentleman Geff up on his left arm while he put
the draught to his lips with his right hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The criminal drained the last drop, and then sank down
upon his pillow, while Longman withdrew his arm and replaced
the empty glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff did not speak again.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was possessed of a fear of talking, lest he should
“commit” himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he now reflected the more, though his deductions
were still confused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No wonder I could not remember the details of my trial—a
trial that never occurred, but was only a dream of
fever. But all the same, if it has not yet come off, it is to
come, unless I go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He laughed a little to himself at this poor joke, and then
he tried to recall the incidents of that “disturbance” at
Haymore Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he could not think consecutively for many minutes
before his thoughts became entangled, and dreams were
mingled with realities, and false inferences deduced from
the union.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I remember now,” he said to himself, “something about
that row at Haymore Hall, though my illness must have
made some things seem vague to me on first recovering my
senses. But I remember now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even as he spoke the words and tried to marshal the facts
in their proper sequence, memory and imagination fled, and
left his mind a vacuum again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some hours later, after Longman had given him a bowl
of strong beef tea and a glass of fine old port wine, his
mental faculties rallied again, though feebly, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>thought he could form a correct theory; he would not try to
get help in doing this by asking any question. He was too
much afraid of compromising himself in some way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do recall now,” he told himself, “the cause of that
row at Haymore Hall. Let me see——</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had just arrived with my wife and my brother-in-law
at Haymore, to take possession, when I was met by officers
with a warrant for my arrest on the charge of murder——</p>

<p class='c009'>“How was that, now? Let’s see—oh, yes! I was arrested
upon a warrant, issued under the extradition treaty
with the United States, charged with the murder of Randolph
Hay in California, and of Jennie Montgomery in
New York——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the wretched man paused, shuddered and covered
his face with his hands. The horror of his crime overcame
him, as it had so often done, when it drove him to seek
oblivion in strong drink, and finally made him  a drunkard.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was some time before he could resume his line of
thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” he mused at length, “that I denied the charge
and resisted the arrest, and that there was a fight. One of
the officers clubbed me—on the head—and I fell like an
ox, and knew no more. When I came to myself I was
lying here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He paused again, and seemed to labor to understand his
present position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How came I to be here?” he inquired of himself; and
after a few minutes exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I know! I see it all now! I had given the living
of Haymore to my brother-in-law, Cassius Leegh—the
scoundrel! When I was brained by the club of that constable,
of course I was more a dead than a living man, and
in no condition to be carted off ten miles to the Chuxton
jail! So I was placed under arrest and brought here in
charge of constables. And here I am in my brother-in-law’s
rectory, guarded by officers, and particularly by that
Giant Gerion, who never leaves me, night or day—set fire
to him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff moaned and groaned and tossed until
Longman brought him a glass of milk punch, which seemed
to soothe him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he resumed his self-communings:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>“I wonder, since I am in his rectory, which was also my
gift to him, why I never see Cassius Leegh? And I wonder
where his sister, my bogus wife, is? And, more than all,
I wonder now—what brings James Campbell here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He paused in distress, and then moaned to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I give it up! I give it up! It is all past me! ‘Chaos
has come again.’ But one thing is clear, even in chaos—that
is, I must escape from this house. I must not wait to
be taken to jail, as I should be as soon as the doctor has
pronounced me well enough to be removed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He thought as intensely as he was capable of thinking,
and then suddenly formed a plan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will not get well enough to be removed while I stay
here, and I will escape from the house at the first opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>From this day the patient became a puzzle to his physician
as well as to his attendants. He did not seem to gain
in strength, but to grow weaker and more helpless every
day; notwithstanding that his appetite was good. At night
he was restless and delirious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I confess that this case perplexes me,” Dr. Hobbs admitted
to Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the case grew out of a misunderstanding between the
patient and his attendants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff, not quite in his right mind yet, believed
himself to be under arrest with the prospect of a prison, a
trial and conviction before him; whereas there was no intention
on any one’s part of even making an accusation
against him.</p>

<p class='c009'>His physician and watchers, not knowing the delusion
under which he silently and fearfully suffered, could not
suspect him of playing a part to prolong his sojourn at the
rectory and postpone his transfer to the prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>This state of things continued for a week. There had
been in this time two opportunities for Gentleman Geff to
escape—for, after all, he was not watched as a criminal, but
only as an invalid. There had been two occasions on which
he had been left alone for an hour or two; but on both
these the weather had been terrific with wind, snow and
sleet, and he waited for weather and opportunity both to
favor him together.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one morning, after he had eaten a good breakfast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>lain back on his pillow, and pretended to fall into a stupor,
as usual, when the doctor was expected, something occurred
that frightened him and hurried his operations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor came, accompanied on this occasion by Mr.
Campbell, who did not often intrude his unwelcome presence
into the sick-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor leaned over the bed and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How are you, Capt. Montgomery?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no response.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor then laid his hand gently on the man’s shoulder
to enforce his attention and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How are you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still there was no answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the doctor examined his pulse, temperature and
respiration, and even lifted the eyelids and looked at the
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he turned to Mr. Campbell and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel like giving up the case. I honestly confess I can
make nothing of it. The man’s appetite, digestion and assimilation
are excellent. His pulse is strong, his temperature
normal, his respiration perfect, and yet he seems too
weak to leave his bed, and he falls into delirium or stupor
day and night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray do not give up the case, doctor. If there is any
one you would like to have called in consultation now——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector paused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes, sir, there is. Sir Ichabod Ingoldsby, the
great authority on the diseases of the brain and nervous
system. And to get him from London to the North Riding
of Yorkshire would cost at least two hundred pounds, even
should his engagements permit him to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind what it costs, we will send for him. The
young squire has specially enjoined me to spare no expense,
as he insists on footing all the bills. Give me Sir Ichabod
Ingoldsby’s address. I will telegraph him at once. If his
engagements will permit he may be here this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scarcely this afternoon. He will have to make arrangements.
Besides, he always travels in the middle of the night
to save time. If all should go well we may see him to-morrow
morning. Here is his address,” said Dr. Hobbs,
and he tore a leaf from his tablets and handed it to the rector.
Then both gentlemen left the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br> <span class='large'>A FLIGHT FOR FREEDOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Gentleman Geff had heard every word spoken by the
doctor and the rector. He dared not wait the inspection of
the skilled London specialist, the great court physician,
who would be sure to detect the deception so successfully
imposed upon the simple country practitioner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The eminent Sir Ichabod Ingoldsby might arrive the next
morning. Then he—Montgomery—must escape this very
day or night, let the weather be what it might. Any risk
rather than the certainty of detection and of all the horrors
that must follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the weather was simply awful—“Ragnarok”—“the
darkness of the gods.” The snow had fallen all the preceding
night and all that day. Although there were four windows
in the sick-room, and all the shutters were open, yet
such was the obscurity that the lamps had been lighted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff was not alone until evening, when Longman,
having served an excellent supper to his charge and
left the latter comfortably laid back on his pillow, in what
the nurse supposed to be a safe and sound sleep, withdrew
from the room to take his meal and refresh himself by a
walk up and down the covered front piazza, and no one took
the watcher’s place.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was Gentleman Geff’s golden opportunity, not to be
lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>He got out of bed on tiptoes and went and bolted the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he went to the closet to search for clothes to put on,
if perchance he might find any.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found his own suit that had been taken off him on the
night he was brought to the rectory and put to bed, and in
the pocket of his coat his <i><span lang="fr">portemonnaie</span></i>, well filled as it had
been.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were all there, even to his boots, his socks, his ulster
and his hat. He began to dress himself in great haste, but
suddenly grew very tired, for though not nearly so weak as
he pretended to be, he was not strong.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went to the buffet, where he knew Longman kept his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>wine and medicine, and found a bottle of good old port. He
unstopped it, put the mouth to his lips and took a long
draught, then a deep breath and another long draught, repeated
the process, and—thought he would take the bottle
along with him in his flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>He finished dressing himself without further fatigue, put
the bottle of wine in the pocket of his ulster, and went to
the window overlooking the back garden of the rectory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Escape from the room was safe and easy, as this was the
parlor chamber on the ground floor of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>The window opened, but with a sudden thought he turned
back and put out the lights and locked as well as bolted the
door. These precautions he thought were necessary to delay
the discovery of his flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he went back to the window and stepped through it,
closing it behind him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where now?</p>

<p class='c009'>To the Chuxton railway station and on to London, to
lose himself in that great wilderness of human beings until
he could take ship to some foreign country with which there
was no extradition treaty.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what a night it was! Dark as pitch but for the spectral
light of the snow. The snow was still falling heavily
as ever, but the wind had risen in mighty strength and was
driving not only the falling but the fallen snow into drifts.</p>

<p class='c009'>If he had but a lantern! But that was an impossible convenience
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He drew the bottle from his pocket, took another long
draught from it, replaced it, and set out through “night and
storm and darkness” and bitterest cold on his flight for life.</p>

<p class='c009'>More by instinct or accident than by light and knowledge
he found his way around the back wall of the rectory garden
to that country road which ran in front of the church, the
rectory and Haymore Park, and crossed the highroad at
about a mile distant.</p>

<p class='c009'>The snow fell thicker and faster, the wind rose higher and
stronger, and the night grew colder and darker.</p>

<p class='c009'>He plunged onward through the deepening snow, sometimes
almost smothered in the drifts, and requiring all the
strength he could muster to struggle out of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He lost his way, as it was inevitable he should. Even
had it been day, instead of the darkest night that ever fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>upon the earth, the highroad could not have been distinguished
from the meadows except by certain tall landmarks.
Now it was impossible to distinguish it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff knew that he had lost his way, had hopelessly
lost it, yet he floundered on through the black chaos
on the chance of coming to some place where he could find
shelter from the bitter cold, the beating wind, the bottomless
drifts and the tempest of driving snow that seemed to
be turned to a shower of ice spikes and stung like the sting
of wasps.</p>

<p class='c009'>On and on he floundered and struggled, not daring to
stop, for to stop would be to die.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again and again he applied himself to his bottle until
it was empty. Then he let it fall, for indeed his numbed
hands could scarcely hold it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He grew weaker and weaker; his limbs seemed too heavy
to lift, especially through deep snow; his brain grew dizzy,
his mind confused. He tried to keep his senses and his feet;
he felt that if he sank to the ground it must be into his
grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length the crisis came; his brain reeled, his limbs gave
way, he lost consciousness and fell to the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, at the rectory, Longman took his supper with
his mother in their warm, bright sitting-room adjoining the
kitchen, everything around them looking so much more
comfortable in contrast to the storm raging without.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I pity any poor wayfarer abroad to-night,” said Elspeth
as she took the steaming coffee pot from the hob of the
glowing grate and set it on the table, little guessing that
the poor wretch they had been taking care of for two months
was just setting out to brave it at its worst.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, this is bad enough, but it is nothing at all to the
awful storms among the Sierra Nevadas,” said Longman as
he sat down to the table and took the cup of coffee his
mother had poured out for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>And on her expressing her surprise and wonder, he began
to entertain her with marrow-freezing stories of overwhelmed
trains of emigrant wagons and buried villages of
settlers among the snow mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>This delayed him at the supper table so much longer
than usual that he had but little time to take his “constitutional”
on the covered front piazza.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>So after a turn or two up and down he went into the
house and up to the door of the sick-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned the knob and pushed the door, but found it
was locked within.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What whim is this, I wonder?” he said. “I hope the
London doctor will order the beast to an idiot asylum. I
suppose they wouldn’t take him in with the apes at the Zoo.
Captain! Capt. Montgomery!” he exclaimed, rapping
loudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a sound from within.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he went around to the back piazza and looked
through the windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>All as dark as pitch in the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s up now, I wonder?” he asked himself, and then
went back to the door and tried once more by rapping and
calling to bring some response from the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now the noise reached the rector, who was seated at
his desk in his study writing his sermon.</p>

<p class='c009'>He laid down his pen and came into the hall, where he
found Longman still hammering and calling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter now, Longman?” inquired the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This door is fastened from within, sir, and I can neither
get into the room nor make him hear me,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, unreasonable as it was to try the experiment in
which the giant had failed, the rector said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me try!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman gave way.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector rapped a little cannonade upon the door and
shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Capt. Montgomery!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He might as well have shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jupiter Tonnerres!” to the snowstorm for any good
effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall I burst the door open, sir?” inquired Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what the fellow is up to now!” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven knows!” sighed the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will I break the door open, sir?” again asked Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you may bring me a common table knife with the
thinnest blade you can find, and come with me to the back
piazza.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>They left the door, and a few minutes later met under
the very window by which the fugitive had made his escape,
after re-closing the shutters that fastened with a spring
catch behind him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now with this knife I know how to loosen the catches,”
said the rector; and he laid the blade of the knife flat on the
stone sill, slipped it under the catch, and so opened the
shutters. Then he slipped the knife between the upper and
lower sash of the window and turned the button and so
raised the sash.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is a very badly secured window in case of burglars,”
remarked Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but you see there are no burglars around Haymore.
However, I do intend to have a bolt put on these shutters,”
said the rector, and he stepped through the window into
the room, closely followed by Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>All was dark as pitch but for the dull glow of the coal
fire in the grate.</p>

<p class='c009'>They knew it was utterly useless to call, yet both at the
same moment cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Capt. Montgomery! Where are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>No answer came.</p>

<p class='c009'>Longman took a match from the safe on the mantelpiece,
kindled it at the fire and lighted the astral.</p>

<p class='c009'>The room was illuminated in an instant, and every nook
and cranny clearly visible. Yet no sign of the missing man.
Longman hastened to the bed, from which he drew the curtains.
It was vacant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has run away, sir. The fraud, who pretended to be
so helpless that he couldn’t hold a glass to his lips, has been
playing it on us all this time, as I suspected him of doing
all along, and now he has run away!” said Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I think not. Why should he deceive us? Why
should he run off? No one was going to harm him,” said
the rector, still peering around the room as if he expected to
find Gentleman Geff in some nook or corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He mightn’t have felt so sure of that, sir. A guilty
conscience, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot think but what he has gone off in a fit of violent
mania.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, in that case, he would have gone in his night
clothes, just as he jumped out of bed; but here are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>empty shelves and pegs, with every article of his wearing
apparel gone,” said Longman, coming out of the closet
which he had been examining. “And why should he take
pains to lock and bolt the door, and put out the light so as
to retard the discovery of his flight as long as possible?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know. Lunatics are well known to be very
cunning. But, Longman, he must be instantly followed and
found, if possible. Oh, heavens! Think of the man being
out on such a night as this! He will surely perish,” said
the rector. And he hurriedly unfastened the door, rushed
out into the passage, took his storm cloak from the rack
and his hat from its peg, and while he nervously prepared
himself to brave the tempest he called out again to the
hunter:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Longman! For Heaven’s sake get on your coat and
find a lantern and come with me. There is no one but you
and me to go in search of this wretched man, whom we must
not leave to perish in the snow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost as soon as the rector had ceased to speak, Longman
was by his side, prepared for the expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must have escaped by that back window, which is
the only one that will close with springs. We must search
the road leading for the back gate of the garden. Come,”
said the rector, going before with the lighted lantern, which
he had taken from the hand of Longman.</p>

<p class='c009'>They issued through the rear door, passed through the
garden and out of the rear gate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Holding the lantern near the ground the rector moved
slowly and carefully through the white chaos.</p>

<p class='c009'>The searchers had not groped many yards from the rectory
gate when Mr. Campbell saw something black upon
the white ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stooped to examine it, and cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here he is, Longman; but whether dear or alive, poor
wretch, I do not know. Come and help me to lift him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has not been lying here five minutes, or he would
be covered with snow. So he may not be dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, they had found the body of Gentleman Geff within
fifty yards of the rectory wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the dark night and blinding snow and distracting
wind he had lost his reckoning and wandered in a circle
until he had fallen down where they found him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>They lifted him up and bore him into the rectory to his
own room, undressed him, wrapped him in blankets, and
put him to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was in the deep sleep that precedes death by freezing.
He only partially awoke while they were working over him;
but he did not speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>They gave him warm spiced brandy and water, which he
swallowed mechanically.</p>

<p class='c009'>All night long they watched and worked over him.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the morning, when James Campbell left the sick-room
to make his toilet before going to breakfast, he left Gentleman
Geff in what seemed a good sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, while he sat at table explaining to his wife and
daughter why he had been out of his room all night, Longman
suddenly burst in upon them and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in, for Heaven’s sake! He is taken with a hemorrhage
that I think will carry him off!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Longman, run and fetch Dr. Hobbs. Mrs. Campbell
and myself will attend to Montgomery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The hunter fled out of the front door to fetch the physician,
while Mr. and Mrs. Campbell rushed to the help of
the sufferer.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an appalling spectacle!</p>

<p class='c009'>The blood driven by the freezing cold to the lungs had
congested there, and notwithstanding all the means that
had been taken to restore his consciousness and save his
life, though these means had been thus far successful, yet
the congestion of the lungs had increased until it burst an
artery and the hemorrhage followed. It was not fatal all at
once, for Mr. and Mrs. Campbell called all their skill and
experience into service and succeeded in stopping the flow
before the arrival of the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the latter came to the bedside of the patient he
found him laid back on his bed, as pale as death, as weak as
a new-born infant, and scarcely breathing, his pulse scarcely
beating.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Hobbs approved all the rector had done, and then
inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you get an answer from Sir Ichabod Ingoldsby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, by telegram. He cannot leave London at this
crisis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it does not matter now. This is a case that any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>country doctor or any old woman might understand and
treat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think of his chance of life?” whispered the
rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a poorer one than he has yet had,” replied the doctor,
looking at the pallid, wizen face, that seemed to have
shrunken to half its size since his terrible loss of blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hetty cried for pity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he has any relatives they should be informed, for I do
not think he will ever rise from that bed again,” said Dr.
Hobbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know of none, except the Earl of Engelmeed and the
Viscount Stoors—his uncle and his cousin. I will write to
the earl to-day,” said Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Engelmeed, of Engelwode, in Cumberland? That is
where typhoid fever is raging so fiercely,” remarked Dr.
Hobbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here followed some talk of that pestilence, and finally
the doctor arose and took his leave, promising to return in
the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell wrote to the Earl of Engelmeed, advising
him of his nephew’s dangerous illness, and posted the letter
that forenoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two days later he got a reply, not from the earl, but
from the latter’s steward, announcing the death of the Viscount
Stoors and the extreme illness of Lord Engelmeed,
whose death was hourly expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over this letter the rector fell into deep thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he put on his coat and hat, and taking the letter
with him, walked over to Haymore Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was shown into the library, where he found Ran
reading.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, Mr. Hay. Will you let me look at your
‘Burke’s Peerage’ for a moment?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. How do you do, Mr. Campbell? And how
is your family—and your patient?” inquired Ran as he
arose and shook hands with the rector, and then went to the
bookcase and took down the “Peerage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The family is well. The invalid very low. I received
a letter from the steward of Engelwode this morning, in answer
to the one I wrote to the earl, informing me of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>death of the Viscount Stoors and the extreme illness of
Lord Engelmeed, whose demise was then hourly expected.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed! Had they taken the fever?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. It was madness for them to remain at Engelwode
during its prevalence. It is from hearing of these occurrences
that I wish to consult Burke. I think that since the
death of Lord Stoors, our wretch, Montgomery, is heir presumptive
to the title and estate,” said the rector as he took
the heavy red volume from the hands of the young squire,
laid it on the library table, and sat down to examine it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is as I thought. There is no other son. And Kightly
Montgomery, as the eldest son of the next brother, the late
Gen. Montgomery, is heir presumptive to the earldom, and
may even now be Earl of Engelmeed. Think of it!” exclaimed
the rector as he closed the book. “Wealth and rank,
for which the wretched man periled his soul and fatally
wrecked his life to obtain feloniously, now come to him
lawfully and honorably, but on his deathbed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it is terrible. If he had but waited! Now it seems
the iron of fate—this useless accession to fortune!” sighed
Ran.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br> <span class='large'>WINDING UP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ran and Judy had planned to go to London in the
spring, to live in retirement and to pursue their studies under
private tutors. But as the season opened in all its
beauty they became so enchanted with their delightful
country home that they could not bear the thought of leaving
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t we have a resident tutor?” inquired Ran with
some hesitation as he and Judy were discussing the question
one morning, seated on a rustic bench under an old oak
tree in their lovely lawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘A resident tutor?’” repeated Judy dubiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, such as the gentry have for their children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For their children,’ of course, but not for grown people;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>not for themselves. No, Ran, dear, we could not have
a resident tutor for you and me. That would set the servants
to talking and the neighbors to gossiping; and they
would wonder where we had been brought up, perhaps laugh
at us, perhaps scorn us. I should not mind it for myself,
Ran, but I should mind it a great deal for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is not the way I feel, Judy, dear, for I do not care
a fig what they say of me, but I could not bear to have them
criticise you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, you see, Ran, we could not have a resident tutor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose we shall have to go and hide ourselves in
London to pursue our studies, Judy, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the young woman with a deep sigh, “but
mightn’t we put off going until winter? Oh, it is so hard
to leave this lovely place in the glory of the spring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judy, love, time is passing quickly, and our education is
very backward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Especially mine,” sighed Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I tell you what I will do!” exclaimed Ran with sudden
inspiration. “I will confide the whole matter to Mr.
Campbell, and take counsel with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very thing! And, oh, Ran!” exclaimed Judy, catching
inspiration in her turn, “might he not become our
tutor? Give us an hour three or four times a week?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran fell into thought, but did not reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have so often heard of clergymen taking pupils. Even
taking them in their houses. But he need not do that.
Could he not come to us or let us go to him a few times
every week?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I declare, Judy, darling, that is a splendid idea of yours,
and I will ask him, and if he should consent to do as we
wish, why, then, we need not bother ourselves about going to
London to hide ourselves and look for teachers!” exclaimed
Ran in delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then there need be no gossip. No one need know
what brings the rector to our library or takes us to his
study,” concluded Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will go and see Mr. Campbell at once,” exclaimed Ran,
with boyish eagerness, as he sprang up, seized his hat from
the ground and set off in a brisk walk for the rectory.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he met the rector full tilt at the lodge gate, as Mr.
Campbell was on his way to make a call at the house.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>They both burst out laughing as they came into collision,
and the minister took Ran’s arm, turned him about and
walked with him back to the rustic seat where Judy sat.</p>

<p class='c009'>She rose to welcome the visitor and to make room for
him beside her on the bench.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, ma’am,” he said, lifting his hat and taking
the offered seat. “We have lovely weather just now. It
must be lovely even in London. In fact, there is always delightful
weather in London during May, when the season
is at its height. Do you leave for town soon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I hope not. I never, never, never wish to leave
for town,” said Judy, with a genuine pout.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure I wish you never would,” laughed Mr. Campbell.
“But I thought you were daily expecting to start,”
he added, turning to Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So we have been; but we have postponed our departure
from day to day, from reluctance to leave the country,” replied
the young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the height of the season will soon be over. The
weather will grow warm and London intolerable. Much
as I should desire for my own sake to detain you here, I
should advise you not to delay your departure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we don’t want to go at all! And we were not going
for the sake of the season, anyhow. And it depends on you,
Mr. Campbell, whether we go or not!” exclaimed Judy, taking
the initiative and breaking right into the midst of the
matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On me, Mrs. Hay!” inquired Mr. Campbell, with a puzzled
air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ran, tell him!” commanded Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then Randolph Hay confided to James Campbell the
story of his own and Judy’s neglected education, and their
plans for remedying their defects, and ended by diffidently
proposing that the minister should, if he pleased, become
the director of their studies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fear that my petition is a most presumptuous one, sir;
but I hope and trust that you will not consider it offensive.
If so, I pray you to pardon me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My young friend, on the contrary, your proposal is both
flattering and agreeable. I shall gladly and gratefully undertake
the task for which circumstances as well as, I hope,
college training, have fitted me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>“I thank you with all my heart, Mr. Campbell. You
have made everything smooth and pleasant for us,” heartily
responded Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy caught the minister’s hand, pressed it between both
hers, and so expressed her gratitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later all the details of the engagement were arranged between
the minister and his pupils.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Ran’s pressing entreaty, Mr. Campbell consented to
stay and dine with them that day. And it was during his
visit that the evening mail brought them foreign letters
from Cleve Stuart, with the news of his Uncle John Cleve’s
death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good man gone to his rest,” was the comment of the
clergyman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news of death—even of the death of a stranger whom
we only knew by report—always casts a shadow, for a longer
or a shorter time, over the circle into which it is brought.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bright Judy was the first to smile and dispel the cloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Mr. Campbell, it is so well that you have consented
to take pity on us, for under present circumstances
we could not leave Haymore,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister raised his brows interrogatively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because we must write and ask our friends to come and
spend the summer with us here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I understand,” said the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your patient lingers longer than any of us expected,”
remarked Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Mr. Campbell, “his tenacity of life is
really wonderful, poor soul!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he arose and bade his hosts good-night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff lay slowly sinking at the rectory of Haymore.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cold contracted on that fatal winter night of his attempted
flight had settled on his lungs, and in the deeply
inflamed condition of the whole system from alcoholism,
had fastened with fatal tenacity upon his system.</p>

<p class='c009'>But with the change in the seat of the disease—which,
while it slowly destroyed his lungs, completely relieved his
brain—his mental faculties were perfectly restored, with
clear recollection of all that had transpired, so that he knew
his antecedents and his present surroundings quite as well
as our readers do. He knew also that he had no reason to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>fear prosecution. His only fear—a secret one—was of
death, “and after death the judgment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had not been prosecuted for any of his felonies, which,
indeed, were surrounded by such circumstances as admitted
of their being ignored rather than compounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the documents by which he had seemed to secure a
merely nominal possession of the Haymore estate concerned
the name of Randolph Hay, and for all the law or the public
knew, or need know, that name had been claimed only by
its real owner, the gentleman now in peaceable possession
of the Haymore estate, and never by the impostor who had
tried to take it.</p>

<p class='c009'>So there was no legal obligation upon any one to bring a
criminal prosecution for fraud and forgery upon the dying
malefactor.</p>

<p class='c009'>And as to his heavier crimes of bigamy, robbery and attempted
murder which had been committed in the United
States, there was not the least likelihood that his surrender
under the extradition treaty would ever be demanded by
that government to answer for them before an American
tribunal.</p>

<p class='c009'>All whom he had so deeply injured, or tried to injure,
had freely forgiven him—all, that is to say, except Lamia
Leegh, who in her bitter humiliation was incapable of forgiving
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector had to strive and pray for grace before he
could pardon the man who had wronged his daughter. But
after this grace was given, James Campbell spent many
hours beside the bed of the dying man, reading to him,
praying with him, persuading him to repentance, exhorting
him to faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff was despairing, and at times defiant in
his despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t talk to me, Mr. Campbell. I am as the
devil made me. As I ‘have sown’ I ‘must reap.’ If there
is anything that can give me satisfaction now, it is that,
after all, I have no blood on my conscience. Bad as you
may think me, I was never cut out for a murderer. No,
nor for a drunkard. Circumstances, temptation, opportunity—these
make destiny. I took to drink to drown remorse.
I was a fool for feeling it. Bah! how can a creature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>of destiny be responsible for anything he does? Yet I am
glad there is no blood on my hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell had spoken to Jennie, asking her if she
could not overcome her repugnance so far as to go in and
speak to Montgomery, now that he was in his senses.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Jennie shuddered, as she replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa, he has never even asked to see me, and I am glad
he has not. I have forgiven him. Indeed, indeed I have!
And I pray for him. Indeed, indeed I do! Not only night
and morning, at the regular prayers, but through the day,
whenever I think of him, I pray for him earnestly, fervently.
I do! But, papa, I cannot even endure the thought
of seeing him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, my child, you have not truly forgiven him. You
must pray for yourself, dear—for the gift of the grace of
charity,” gravely replied the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>No, Gentleman Geff had never asked to see his wife or
child: never even referred to either. Mr. Campbell was not
sure that the man knew they were in the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one morning, when the rector was sitting beside him,
Montgomery suddenly said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it is a confounded shame that a sick man cannot
be permitted to see his wife and child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you can be permitted to see them. Do you wish to
do so?” gently inquired the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think I did. I have never even set eyes on the
boy, and he must be about nine months old by this time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your child is not a boy, but a girl,” said the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now there! I did not even know the sex of my own
child, who is nearly a year old, and has been under the same
roof with me for several weeks. And this a Christian household!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you feel equal to the interview, I will go and call
my daughter now and ask her to come and bring the little
girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Let her come alone the first time. One at a time
is all I can stand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Campbell went down to the back parlor, where he
found his wife and daughter seated at their needlework.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie, my darling,” he said, gently laying his hand upon
her head, “Montgomery has just asked to see you. Will
you come to him?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>“Oh, papa! I cannot! I cannot!” she replied, with a
shiver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not come to a dying—yes, I must say it,” he added,
after a painful hesitation—“husband, when he sends for
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has forfeited that name, papa,” very firmly replied
the wronged wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must forgive him, my child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do forgive him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, you must come with me to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa, I cannot! Indeed I cannot!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you do not forgive him, although he is dying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he dying, papa?” she inquired in a pitiful voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not this moment, my dear. But Dr. Hobbs declares
that he cannot live many days in any case, and may not live
an hour if another hemorrhage should come on. Will you
come with me, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, papa, I cannot!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie, how can you be so hard-hearted?” demanded
her mother, now entering into the conversation for the first
time. “I am ashamed of you, and afraid for you lest you
be punished. After the man is dead and gone, and you can
never be kind to him again, you will be sorry. Go, at least,
and speak to him if you only stay one minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Jennie,” said her father.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then the young woman arose and followed the
clergyman to the sick-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>She entered that room under protest; but when she saw
the ghastly, death-stricken face, the skeleton hand stretched
out to her, the hollow, sunken, unearthly eyes fixed upon
her, she uttered a low cry of horror and pity, and sank down
on her knees beside the bed, took his hand and dropped
her face upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector turned and left the room, closing the door
after him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there, don’t cry! What is the use? Jennie, I am
sorry that I ever hurt you in any way. That is what I
wanted to say to you, and that is why I sent for you,” he
said, speaking in a rather faint and faltering voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not reply, but sobbed in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jennie, did you hear what I said to you?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I heard,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>“Well, I said I was sorry I hurt you. Well, Jennie?” he
asked, and then paused as if expecting some definite answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I, too, am sorry that you hurt me, or anybody else, or
yourself worse than all, Kightly. I am very sorry, and I
pray to the Lord for you daily, almost hourly. Do you pray
for yourself, Kightly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I don’t! What would be the use? ‘God is not
mocked.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But ‘He is full of compassion,’ Kightly. He——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, that will do!” said the sick man, interrupting
her. “You know nothing about it! Go now. I have said
what I sent for you to say to you. Now go, please. I can’t
stand much of this sort of thing,” he muttered in a weak,
petulant voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will come again to you when you want me, Kightly,”
she said, rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. And bring the youngster—but not to-day.
There, there—go along with you,” said the man, turning his
face to the wall and closing his eyes. Jennie left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day she took the baby in to see its father.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sat down in a chair beside the bed, and sat the baby
on the top of the bed near its father’s head.</p>

<p class='c009'>And there she watched it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man showed but very little interest in his child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought, of course, it was a boy,” he said; “but, poor
little devil, it is better that it should be a girl, for I have
no money to leave it, but being a girl, it can marry some
of these days and live on some other fellow’s money. Take
it away now, Jennie. I can’t stand much of it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the mortified young mother took away the dazed and
depressed baby and afterward said to her own mamma:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never knew Essie to behave so stupidly. You might
have thought she was a little idiot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor baby! The dark room and the haggard man subdued
her spirits. It is a wonder she had not cried,” replied
the grandmother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very glad she did not—that would have made him
worse,” said Jennie.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this the sinking man declined daily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie spent hours at his bedside, often having the baby
with her when he could bear it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Mrs. Campbell had been a daily visitor and an occasional
nurse from the time he was first brought to the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Longman never left him except for necessary rest
and refreshment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gamekeeper’s cottage was ready for occupancy, but
neither the mother nor the son would leave the suffering
sinner to take possession of its comforts and emoluments.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Ran heartily excused them both under the circumstances
and paid the man’s salary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman Geff had never been told of the death of his
cousin, the Viscount Stoors. It was thought by his attendants
that the news of the decease of a relative that left
him, the dying sinner, heir presumptive of an earldom,
would be, if not too sorrowful, certainly too startling, too
exciting for the safety of an invalid, whose pulse must not
be hurried in the slightest degree lest it should bring on a
hemorrhage that must carry off the patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, about this time, Montgomery rallied, and
seemed so much better that the doctor allowed him to sit
up in bed, propped by pillows.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell sat by him, reading aloud the morning’s
paper, when Longman came in bringing a letter, which he
placed in the hands of the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was in a deep, black-bordered envelope, sealed with a
broad black seal and directed to</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me!” he said, and stepped quickly to the furthest
window lest the sick man should see the herald of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened and read the letter, which was from Abel
Stout, the steward of Engelwode, and was as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Rev. and Dear Sir</span>: It is my painful duty to announce
to you the decease of Charles-George-Francis-Henry, tenth
earl of Engelmeed, who expired at one-fifteen this A. M.,
and of the succession of Capt. the Hon. Kightly Montgomery
as eleventh earl. I inclose a letter, which I beg you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>to be so kind as to hand to his lordship, if my lord is still
in your house, or to forward to his address if he should have
left, as the presence of his lordship here is imperatively
necessary. I have the honor to remain, reverend sir,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your obedient servant,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“<span class='sc'>Abel Stout</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The inclosed letter was superscribed very formally in full
title to</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Right Honorable</div>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>The Earl of Engelmeed</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>James Campbell stared at this superscription and then
glanced at the wreck on the bed, who now bore the dignity
of an earldom.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could not hesitate to deliver this letter, however it
might affect his patient. He must deliver it! He had no
choice.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what a shock! what a revelation! what a mockery it
would now be to him!—to him who had sinned for wealth
and rank, who had sold his birthright for a mess of pottage
and found the dish—poisoned!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl of Engelmeed was dead. His son and heir-apparent
had died before him, and now—their next of kin,
their worthless relative, Kightly Montgomery, the penniless
adventurer, who had been driven by greed of gold and love
of luxury to crime and to death—the sinful, dying Kightly
Montgomery, was now master of Engelwode, with a rent roll
of twenty thousand pounds a year!</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah, if he had only been good and true, he would have
lived to enjoy the old title and the rich estate—more honors
than he could possibly have gained by all his crimes, even
though each one of them had been a complete success!</p>

<p class='c009'>But now, what a cruel mockery of fate!</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Campbell, reflecting on all these matters, felt really
sorry for the wretched criminal, to whom the unexpected
news of his succession to the earldom, coming to him in his
last hours, must truly seem the bitterest irony of fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have bad news there,” said the dying man, glancing
at the broad, black-edged envelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I fear so. It comes from Engelwode, in Cumberland,
where you have relatives, I think,” replied the rector
gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>“Oh, yes, relatives!” sneered the new earl, who did not
even suspect that he was one.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A little more than kin, and less than kind.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There is no love lost between us, believe me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hearing this, the rector did not consider it necessary to
be very cautious in breaking this news. Nevertheless, he
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me give you your restorative before we say anything
more about the letter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he arose and poured out the draught, some powerful
tonic, compounded of beef, coca and brandy, and administered
it. Then he replaced the glass on the table and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The letter is for you, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the devil do you mean?” demanded the new earl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you take the letter and look at it? Have you light
enough? Shall I draw up the shades?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said the patient, taking the letter and squinting
at it. “This is for my uncle, not for me. Though how it
should have come here I can’t imagine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your lordship’s uncle, the late earl, is dead, my lord,”
quietly replied the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dead! But there is Stoors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He died before his father. But read your letter, my
lord,” said the rector, purposely ringing the changes on the
title that he would have too much good taste to bestow on
the heir of an earldom under ordinary circumstances, but
on this impenitent sinner, on this unpunished felon, on this
dying peer, he lavished the honor with unction in the very
bitterness of irony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Read your letter, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot! Oh, this is too terrible!” groaned the dying
earl, covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did he mean, or did the rector for one moment believe
that he meant, the sudden death of his relatives, so near
together, was too terrible?</p>

<p class='c009'>No, indeed. The man meant, and the rector knew that
he meant, to receive this rich and august inheritance just at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>the hour of death was indeed “too terrible”—was insupportable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor wretch! he burst into tears and sobbed aloud, dropping
back on his pillow and turning his face to the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray try to be calm, my lord. This emotion will do
you a mischief,” pleaded Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go and bring my wife and child to me. Let me tell
them the news,” he exclaimed, and then burst into the most
sarcastic peal of laughter the rector thought he had ever
heard. He left the room and went to find his daughter,
whom he came upon, as usual, seated beside her mother and
engaged in needlework over the baby’s cradle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my dear. Montgomery wants you. Bring the
little one along with you. And, Hetty, dear, you had better
come also,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both women looked up anxiously, half expecting that this
was their final summons to the sick-room; that now “the
end of earth” for Kightly Montgomery was at hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is anything the matter, Jim?” inquired Hetty, while
Jennie’s eyes asked the same question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“News of Montgomery’s relatives in Cumberland, that is
all,” replied the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What news?” demanded Hetty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He prefers to announce it in person.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! How mysterious we are! Come on, Jennie!”
said Mrs. Campbell, taking her husband’s arm and
leading the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie picked up her baby and followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>They entered the sick-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sick man held out his hand to his wife, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come here, Jennie, my girl! You are Countess of
Engelmeed! Did you know it? And that doll in your
arms is Lady Esther Montgomery!—for a few hours only
while I draw the breath of life. Afterward you will only
be countess dowager, while she will be countess in her own
right. For the earldom of Engelmeed is not a male feoff
exclusively, but failing the male line which fails in me, will
‘fall to the distaff,’ as represented by that rag baby of yours.
So I think—you are com——” He paused in sudden pain
and prostration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not speak again for the present, my lord. You will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>hurt yourself. Rest a while,” said the rector, while Jennie
looked at her mother in helpless dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is delirious again, my dear,” whispered Mrs. Campbell
in reply to that look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stoop down——” muttered the dying man in a low,
faint, husky voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie bent over him to catch his failing words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will be—compensated—for all—you have gone
through—by being made—a countess—you ought——”</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice suddenly ceased. A spasm of pain traversed
his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My lord! my lord! Have mercy on yourself and keep
still,” pleaded the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was too late. A wild look flew into the eyes of the
dying man and fixed them on the rector’s face. A torrent
of blood gushed from his mouth. Gentleman Geff had
spoken his last words, and in a very few minutes he had
drawn his last breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jennie threw herself sobbing into the arms of her father.
She was too young to have much self-control, but whether
now she wept from grief, horror or compassion, or all three
combined, she could not herself have told.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her father took her babe to his bosom and led her to her
own room, where he made her lie down on her bed and
placed the child beside her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rector went to his study and wrote a letter to the
steward at Engelwode, telling him what had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he walked over to Haymore Hall to carry the news
to Mr. Randolph Hay and to confer with him on what was
next to be done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Judy were both shocked and grieved at the fate
of their enemy—their enemy, however, only in so far as he
tried to wrong them primarily with the wish to benefit himself
rather than to injure them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The remains should be taken to Engelwode Castle and
placed in the family vault, of course,” said the rector. “And
as the last earl died without having had time to make a
will between his succession and his death, my granddaughter,
the little countess, will be a ward in chancery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And no doubt the lord chancellor will constitute you,
sir, the guardian of her person and a trustee of her estate,”
added Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>“Perhaps—most likely, indeed; in which case they will
associate some other reliable man with me in the onerous
charge. And I should like you to be that man, Hay,”
pleaded the parson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure; if the lord chancellor will appoint me,”
answered Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Jennie much distressed, sir?” inquired Judy, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam. She is very much agitated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I go to her? Could I do her any good?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel sure you could. I should feel very grateful to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy hurried into the house and got her wraps, and
came out to join the rector in his walk homeward.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the rectory door they were met by Mrs. Campbell, who,
after very gravely saluting Judy and thanking her for coming,
turned to the rector and inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was all that the wretched man was rambling
about in his last hour? Was there any foundation of truth
in it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was all truth, Hetty, from foundation rock—to carry
out your simile—to capping stone; and baby Essie is now
Countess of Engelmeed in her own right and a ward in
chancery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well, well! She doesn’t know it—Jennie, I mean,
of course. She thinks he was out of his head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I saw she did; but it is true,” said the rector, as
they entered the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>A week later the remains of the last Earl of Engelmeed
were laid in the vault of his forefathers, amid all</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'>“The pride, pomp and circumstance”</div>

<p class='c011'>of  funeral parade.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the ceremonies the rector, with his wife, daughter
and grandchild, returned to the rectory, where they were
all to live during the minority of the infant countess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran and Judy came back to their beloved home, but had
scarcely got settled there when they received letters announcing
the speedy arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Cleve Stuart,
with their children and a friend—Mr. O’Melaghlin, of
Arghalee, in Antrim.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>“I wonder who he is,” pondered Ran, as he took the letter
over to the rectory to show it to Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I know the name and the place, but not the man.
I have been to Arghalee. All except the very ground on
which the ancient castle stands, and which the impoverished
O’Melaghlin would not sell under any stress of fortune,
forms a part of the duke’s estate. The castle is one of the
show places of the neighborhood; not for its parks, plantations
or picture galleries, by any means—for there are none—but
for the great antiquity of the ruins. The owner was
supposed to be traveling abroad. He is The O’Melaghlin
in question, of course. The guidebook to the ancient castle
shows the family to be lineal descendants from Roderick
O’Melaghlin, monarch of Meath, and more remotely from
Konn, a somewhat mythical king of prehistoric Ireland.
So, you see, you will have an illustrious guest, though he
may be as poor as ‘Job’s turkey.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; the letter says he has made an immense fortune in
the gold mines of Australia, and is coming back to live on
his estate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When do you expect them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the next steamer—for this letter was written from
New York the day before they were to start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” said the rector.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Ran, having communicated his good news, went
home to his Judy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIX<br> <span class='large'>“ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, Cleve, Palma, their children, servant, and,
last and loftiest, The O’Melaghlin were coming over as fast
as wind and steam could bring them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had unusually fine weather for the whole trip. They
made some very pleasant acquaintances, and formed some
very fast friendships among their fellow passengers, with
whom they were all very popular.</p>

<p class='c009'>The eccentricities of The O’Melaghlin were endless
sources of amusement to the passengers as to our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>party, to whom they were also causes of frequent annoyance.</p>

<p class='c009'>For instance, O’Melaghlin always addressed Mr. Cleve
Stuart as “Wolfscliff.” And not infrequently, when he
had had too much wine for dinner, the chieftain would hail
his friend from across the table as “O’Wolfscliff,” or speak
of him to another person as “The O’Wolfscliff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides this, he would reiterate, in season and out of season,
his injunction that Mr. and Mrs. Cleve Stuart should
preserve, inviolate, the secret of his relationship to Mike
and Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Moind ye don’t let on to them,” he repeated. “I am
to be inthrodooced as a frind of your own, claiming, in
right of you, the hospitality of Misther and Misthress Randolph
Hay. And I am to have a week or tin days to observe
me childer before they suspect me. That will lave me find
them out as they are widout pritinces. Do ye moind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” Stuart would reply, heartily tired, yet half
amused at the man’s persistence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yerself will not brathe a syllable that will lave
them suspict I’m anything to themselves, Misthress
Stuart?” he persevered, turning to Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a syllable, O’Melaghlin,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>This funny persecution ceased for the time, to be renewed
as soon as they landed at Liverpool, and continued all the
way from that city to York, and from there to Chuxton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a hint, not a breath, not a look, to bethray to the
childer that they behold in me the father of them, and a
discindint of the ancient kings of Meath,” he said, as the
train drew into the Chuxton station.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Not a hint, not a breath, not a look’ from us shall
betray your secret, O’Melaghlin,” Cleve assured him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed,” Palma added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be the powers, if ye bethray me, I nivir spake to aither
of yez again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There,” said Stuart, as they all rose to leave the train,
“there is Mr. Randolph Hay himself come in the barouche
to meet us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?” demanded The O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, on the other side of the road. That gentleman
in the open carriage with the fine bays and the footman in
russet livery,” replied Cleve, pointing to the “turnout.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>“Be the club of Konn! That foine fellow the son-in-law
of meself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gintleman that married me Judy when she was a
nady orphan, and he didn’t suspict she could be the daughter
of a hundred kings?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me at him!” exclaimed The O’Melaghlin, pushing
to the front and passing through the crowd on the platform
to the side of the barouche, just as Ran got down from his
seat to welcome his friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m The O’Melaghlin, Misther Hay. And it’s proud I
am to make the acquaintance of ye. You’re a noble man,
that ye are—that ye are. Wolfscliff is behoind. I could not
wait for him to inthrodooce you. But I’m The O’Melaghlin,
and you are Misther Hay!” he exclaimed, seizing the hand
of Ran and shaking it to nearly dislocation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran was somewhat dismayed, not knowing how to account
for this overwhelming salute that almost deprived
him of the power to respond, and say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very happy to meet you, Mr. O’Melaghlin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Misther?” repeated the chief, prompt to take exception
to such a common title applied to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>But fortunately Stuart came up, shook hands with Ran
and then presented Palma, who was warmly welcomed by
her cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Wolfscliff, will ye be afther inthrodoocing
Misther Hay to meself?” demanded Ran’s father-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon, I thought you had,” said Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Divil a bit could I do that same to his intilligince,” replied
the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I will have that honor,” laughed Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>And assuming the courtly dignity of a lord chamberlain
at a royal reception, he bowed to the descendant of Irish
kings, and with a wave of his hand, to indicate the inferior
person, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The O’Melaghlin, of Arghalee, I have the honor to present
to you, sir, Mr. Randolph Hay, of Haymore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ran bowed very solemnly, conscious now that he stood
in the presence of an “eccentric.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, sure, meself fales honored in the relationship—I
mane the acquaintanceship,” graciously replied The O’Melaghlin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>feeling, however, that he had almost betrayed himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you take seats in the carriage now? My servants
are here with the break and a van to bring your people and
luggage,” said Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleve bowed and handed Palma to a back seat, and The
O’Melaghlin to a place beside her. Then he took a front
seat, where Ran joined him, and the barouche started for
Haymore Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The drive through the beautiful country, now in the
glory of early summer, charmed both Cleve and Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a boundless Garden of Eden!” exclaimed the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>But beauty and glory in nature was quite lost on The
O’Melaghlin, who employed the time in descanting to his
son-in-law upon the ancient royalty and grandeur of the
O’Melaghlins until the carriage turned into the park gate,
where Longman stood to welcome them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, that was a foine sivin-footer—that retainer of
yours, Haymore. Jist such min me ancestor, Roderick
O’Melaghlin, last monarch of Meath, had for his bodyguard,
armed with spears and battle-axes, iviry man of them,” said
the chieftain, as the carriage rolled up the avenue toward
the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it drew up in front of the Hall, there stood Mike
and Judy, the beautiful young pair, as much alike in their
dark loveliness as twin brother and sister could possibly be.
Both in evening dress; Mike in the conventional black
swallowtail and patent leathers, with a sprig of shamrock
in his buttonhole in honor of the visitor. Judy in a dark
blue satin dress, trained, and with low body and short
sleeves, showing the plump neck and round arms, which
were now dimly veiled with fine lace and adorned with the
Haymore diamonds in honor of the guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behind them stood an array of servants.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is your son and daughter, O’Melaghlin,” whispered
Palma in the ear of the chief, as he sat beside her.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked out and saw the beautiful pair, with their
lovely faces lighted up now with the joy of expectancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! thim? You don’t mane thim!” he exclaimed,
gazing at them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do. They are Mike and Judy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Och! let me at thim—the angels!—the beauties! They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>are both the imidge of their mother, me sainted Moira!
Let me at thim!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And with a bound The O’Melaghlin was out of the
barouche and tearing up the stairs to the presence of his
astonished children.</p>

<p class='c009'>Forgotten were all his plans of secrecy and covert observation.
The father’s pride and joy in the Irishman’s warm
heart overbore all resolutions, and he fell upon his son and
daughter with ravenous delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so ye are me own childer—me Mike and me Judy!
And the jewels that ye are!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was Judy he clasped to his breast and covered with
kisses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mike! Mike! save me!” exclaimed the frightened
and distressed daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will ye be afther kapin’ yer hands to yerself?” exclaimed
Mike, who thought the stranger was a maniac, and
tried to separate him from the terrified victim. But Mike
was no match for The O’Melaghlin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aisy! aisy!” exclaimed the chieftain. “It’s jealous ye
are of me affection for the sister av ye! But your turn will
come nixt, me bhoy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately Ran, to whom Cleve had hastily communicated
the now open secret, came hurrying up the stairs, leaving
Stuart and Palma for the moment in the barouche.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop! stop! Mike, my lad! The gentleman is your
father. Yes, dear Judy, your father. Do not be afraid of
him,” he exclaimed, coming to the rescue with the explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yis, darlint Judy, it’s the fayther av ye that’s pressin’
ye to this throbbin’ heart av him! It’s the fayther av ye,
me foine Mike, that will make ye the lawful heir av the
oldest name and richest estate in ould Ireland! Yis, I
meant to have kept that same a secret till I had watched
the natures av ye both for a wake or two, but me affections
were too much for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While he spoke he was kissing Judy, patting Mike on the
shoulder or embracing them both and holding them together
to his breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, quite overcome by his emotion, he sank down
upon the top step and covered his face with his hands to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>hide the tears that might have seemed a reproach to the
descendant of the warlike monarchs of Meath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike and Judy raised him up with tender care and led
him into the hall and thence into the drawing-room, while
the old butler, without waiting orders, went and brought a
tray with a decanter of brandy and a glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>The O’Melaghlin saw the elixir of life and revived at the
sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Ran returned to the barouche to conduct
Stuart and Palma to the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He made me and my wife swear by all the saints in
Christendom that we would not betray his secret until he
himself should give us leave, and lo! he has blurted it out
himself,” laughed Stuart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. He seems a very eccentric person, this unexpected
father-in-law of mine. Yet I like what I have seen
of him,” replied Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will like him better. The longer you know him
the more you will esteem him. And if you will consider
the eccentricities of his fate and fortune, you will understand
and forgive the eccentricities of his character,” replied
Cleve.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then they followed their host into the house and into
the drawing-room, where they found The O’Melaghlin
seated on a sofa between his son and daughter, with his left
arm around Judy’s waist, and in his right hand a wineglass
of brandy which he sipped at intervals, while Mike held the
decanter ready to replenish the glass when necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as soon as Ran came in with the Stuarts The O’Melaghlin
gave the glass to Judy to hold and went to meet
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He seized the hand of Ran, and shaking it again cruelly
and almost to dislocation, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me son-in-law! Me brave, good, thrue bhoy! I have
not yet greeted ye, nor wilcomed ye as me son-in-law! But
now I will do it, with the highest praise mortal man could
give ye. I will say: Haymore, sir, ye are worthy to be the
husband of me daughter Judy and the daughter of a thousand
kings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you, sir. I am sure that is the highest praise
you could give me. I hope it is true,” gallantly replied
Ran.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Servants were at hand to show the guests to their apartments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mike did the honors to his father, and accompanied him
to the apartments prepared for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judy attended Palma to the beautiful suit of rooms that
had been fitted up for Mr. and Mrs. Stuart and their
children.</p>

<p class='c009'>There Judy for the first time made acquaintance with
Palma’s lovely children, whom she found already on the
nursery cot, asleep and attended by the faithful Hatty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, when did these beauties come? Why have I not
seen them before?” demanded Judy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They came in the second carriage with Hatty and Josias.
I would trust them with those two as confidently as with
myself and their father,” replied Palma.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I was so taken by surprise at the sudden meeting
with my father that I forgot even to inquire after the
darlings! I beg your little pardons!” said Judy, kneeling
by the side of the children’s cot and kissing their sleeping
faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>At dinner the newly arrived visitors met the Rev. Mr. and
Mrs. Campbell, who had been invited to meet them. Jennie—the
Countess Dowager of Engelmeed—being in deep
mourning for her husband, did not go out or receive visitors.</p>

<p class='c009'>A week of idleness on the part of all the family followed
at Haymore Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that questions of importance were taken up.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was decided that The O’Melaghlin, with Mr. and Mrs.
Hay and Mr. and Mrs. Stuart and Mike, should set out on
an excursion to Arghalee Castle and find lodging at
Arghalee Arms, and from that vantage point investigate
the ancient ruins and see what could be done toward the
successful restoration of the castle, also open negotiations
with the duke’s legal steward if possible to repurchase all
the land that had once constituted the Arghalee estate.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this was happily effected in the course of a few
months—for The O’Melaghlin stopped at nothing in his
eager desire to restore the ancient magnificence and splendor
of his house; and so he paid twice the worth of the
land to get it back, and fabulous sums to the antiquaries
and architects to restore the castle and the chapel in all
their pristine strength and glory.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>The Stuarts remained at Haymore until the last of the
summer and then bade affectionate adieus to the Hays and
returned to Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the first of many visits, which the Hays often
returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>That autumn Mike was entered as Michael O’Melaghlin,
master of Arghalee, in one of the best preparatory colleges
in Glasgow.</p>

<p class='c009'>That winter, when “Burke’s Landed Gentry” appeared,
under the name of Hay it contained this item:</p>

<p class='c013'>Hay, Randolph, born January 1, 185—, succeeded his
father March 1, 187—, married December 2, 187—, Judith,
only daughter of Michael, The O’Melaghlin, Chief of
Arghalee, Antrim.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the anxious soul of Will Walling, when he received
a copy of the book with the marked passage, was entirely
satisfied.</p>

<p class='c009'>And New Year’s Day brought Ran and Judy a New
Year’s gift, in the form of a son and heir, which filled the
hearts of the parents with bliss.</p>

R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, “Richelieu,” and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal’s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar’s conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the statecraft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p>

<p class='c008'>A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE. A story of American Colonial Times. By
Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.</p>

<p class='c008'>THE TOWER OF LONDON. A Historical Romance of the Times of Lady
Jane Grey and Mary Tudor. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with
four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>This romance of the “Tower of London” depicts the Tower as palace,
prison and fortress, with many historical associations. The era is the
middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c013'>The story is divided into two parts, one dealing with Lady Jane Grey,
and the other with Mary Tudor as Queen, introducing other notable characters
of the era. Throughout the story holds the interest of the reader
in the midst of intrigue and conspiracy, extending considerably over a
half a century.</p>

<p class='c008'>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING. A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.</p>

<p class='c008'>GARTHOWEN. A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character—the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath.... We call this a well-written story. Interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent.”—Detroit Free
Press.</p>

<p class='c008'>MIFANWY. The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allan Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination.”—Boston Herald.</p>

<p class='c008'>DARNLEY. A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a historical romance “Darnley” is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.</p>

<p class='c013'>If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic “field of the cloth of
gold” would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.</p>

<p class='c008'>WINDSOR CASTLE. A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII.
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Windsor Castle” is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. “Bluff King Hal,” although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King’s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p>

<p class='c008'>HORSESHOE ROBINSON. A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>

<p class='c013'>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>Take it all in all, “Horseshoe Robinson” is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008'>THE PEARL OF ORR’S ISLAND. A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>Written prior to 1862, “The Pearl of Orr’s Island” is ever new; a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the “sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr’s Island,” and straightway
comes “the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel’s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother’s breast.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in “The Pearl of Orr’s Island.”</p>

<p class='c008'>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER. A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>A book rather out of the ordinary is this “Spirit of the Border.” The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>

<p class='c013'>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian “Village
of Peace” are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>

<p class='c013'>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE. By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U.S.N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
“who go down in ships” been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is “Captain Brand,”
who, as the author states on his title page, was a “pirate of eminence in
the West Indies.” As a sea story pure and simple, “Captain Brand” has
never been excelled, and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.</p>

<p class='c008'>NICK OF THE WOODS. A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
“Nick of the Woods” will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird’s clever and versatile pen.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUY FAWKES. A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason. By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>The “Gunpowder Plot” was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p>

<p class='c008'>TICONDEROGA: A Story of Early Frontier Life in the Mohawk Valley.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four page illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>The setting of the story is decidedly more picturesque than any ever
evolved by Cooper: The frontier of New York State, where dwelt an English
gentleman, driven from his native home by grief over the loss of his wife,
with a son and daughter. Thither, brought by the exigencies of war, comes
an English officer, who is readily recognised as that Lord Howe who met his
death at Ticonderoga. As a most natural sequence, even amid the hostile
demonstrations of both French and Indians, Lord Howe and the young girl
find time to make most deliciously sweet love, and the son of the recluse has
already lost his heart to the daughter of a great sachem, a dusky maiden
whose warrior-father has surrounded her with all the comforts of a civilized
life.</p>

<p class='c013'>The character of Captain Brooks, who voluntarily decides to sacrifice his
own life in order to save the son of the Englishman, is not among the least
of the attractions of this story, which holds the attention of the reader even
to the last page. The tribal laws and folk lore of the different tribes of
Indians known as the “Five Nations,” with which the story is interspersed,
shows that the author gave no small amount of study to the work in question,
and nowhere else is it shown more plainly than by the skilful manner in
which he has interwoven with his plot the “blood” law, which demands a
life for a life, whether it be that of the murderer or one of his race.</p>

<p class='c013'>A more charming story of mingled love and adventure has never been
written than “Ticonderoga.”</p>

<p class='c008'>ROB OF THE BOWL: A Story of the Early Days of Maryland. By John
P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four page illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was while he was a member of Congress from Maryland that the
noted statesman wrote this story regarding the early history of his native
State, and while some critics are inclined to consider “Horse Shoe Robinson”
as the best of his works, it is certain that “Rob of the Bowl” stands at the
head of the list as a literary production and an authentic exposition of the
manners and customs during Lord Baltimore’s rule. The greater portion of
the action takes place in St. Mary’s—the original capital of the State.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a series of pictures of early colonial life in Maryland, “Rob of the
Bowl” has no equal, and the book, having been written by one who had
exceptional facilities for gathering material concerning the individual members
of the settlements in and about St. Mary’s, is a most valuable addition
to the history of the State.</p>

<p class='c013'>The story is full of splendid action, with a charming love story, and a
plot that never loosens the grip of its interest to its last page.</p>

<p class='c008'>BY BERWEN BANKS. By Allen Raine.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a tender and beautiful romance of the idyllic. A charming picture
of life in a Welsh seaside village. It is something of a prose-poem, true,
tender and graceful.</p>

<p class='c008'>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING. A romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c013'>The story opens in the month of April, 1775, with the provincial troops
hurrying to the defense of Lexington and Concord. Mr. Hotchkiss has etched
in burning words a story of Yankee bravery and true love that thrills from
beginning to end with the spirit of the Revolution. The heart beats quickly,
and we feel ourselves taking a part in the exciting scenes described. You
lay the book aside with the feeling that you have seen a gloriously true
picture of the Revolution. His whole story is so absorbing that you will sit
up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance it is charming.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
